<p class='noindent'>SAFETY DEVICES that do not protect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Unsinkable” ships that, before the days of Bergenholm
and of atomic and cosmic energy, sank into the waters of
Earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>More particularly, safety devices which, while protecting
against one agent of destruction, attract magnet-like
another and worse. Such as the armored cable within the
walls of a wooden house. It protects the electrical conductors
within it against accidental external shorts; but, inadequately
grounded, it may attract and upon occasion has
attracted the stupendous force of lightning. Then, steel
armor exploding into incandescence inside walls and ceilings,
that house’s existence thereafter is to be measured in
minutes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Specifically, four lightning rods. The lightning rods protecting
the chromium, glass, and plastic home of Neal
Cloud. Those rods were adequately grounded, with copper-silver
cables the size of a big man’s forefinger; for
Neal Cloud, Doctor of Nucleonics, knew his lightning and
was taking no chances whatever with the safety of his wife
and children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not know, did not even suspect, that under
certain conditions of atmospheric potential and of ground-magnetic
stress his perfectly-designed and perfectly-installed
system would become a super-powerful attractor
for flying vortices of atomic disintegration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So now Neal Cloud, nucleonicist, sat at his desk in a
strained, dull apathy. His face was a yellowish-gray white,
his tendoned hands gripped rigidly the arms of his chair.
His eyes, hard and lifeless, stared unseeingly past the
small, three-dimensional block portrait of all that had
made life worth living.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For his guardian against lightning had been a vortex-magnet
at the moment when some luckless wight had tried
to abate the nuisance of a “loose” atomic vortex. That
wight dies, of course—they almost always did—and the
vortex, instead of being destroyed, was simply broken up
into a number of widely-scattered new vortices. And one
of those bits of furious, uncontrolled energy, resembling a
handful of substance torn from the depths of a sun, darted
toward and shot downward to earth through Neal Cloud’s
new house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That house did not burn; it exploded. Nothing of it, in
it, or near it stood a chance, for in a few seconds the
place where it had been was a crater of seething, boiling
lava—a crater which filled the atmosphere with poisonous
vapors; which flooded all nearby space with lethal radiations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cosmically, the whole thing was infinitesimal. Ever
since man learned how to use atomic power the vortices
of disintegration had been breaking out of control. Such
accidents had been happening, and would continue to
happen. More than one world, perhaps, had been or
would be consumed to the last gram by such loose atomic
vortices. What of that? Of what real importance are a few
grains of sand to a pile five thousand miles long, a hundred
miles wide, and ten miles deep?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even to that individual grain of sand called “Earth”—or,
in modern parlance, “Sol Three,” or “Tellus of Sol,” or
simply “Tellus”—the affair was negligible. One man had
died; but, in dying, he had added one more page to the
thick bulk of negative results already on file. That Mrs.
Cloud and her children had perished was merely unfortunate.
The vortex itself was not yet a real threat to Tellus.
It was a “new” one, and thus it would be a long time
before it would become other than a local menace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor, to any except a tiny fraction of Earth’s inhabitants,
was the question of loose atomic vortices a matter
of concern. It was unthinkable that Tellus, the point of
origin and the very center of Galactic Civilization, could
cease to exist. Long before such vortices could eat away
much of her mass, or poison much of her atmosphere,
Earth’s scientists would have solved the problem.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But to Neal Cloud the accident was ultimate catastrophe.
His personal universe had crashed in ruins; what was
left was not worth picking up. He and Jo had been
married for more than fifteen years and the bonds between
them had grown stronger, deeper, truer with every
passing day. And the kids .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it <span class='it'>couldn’t</span> have happened
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. fate COULDN’T do this to him .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but it had .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it
could. Gone .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <span class='it'>gone</span> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. GONE!</p>

<p class='pindent'>And to Neal Cloud, sitting there at his desk in black
abstraction, with maggots of thought gnawing holes in his
mind, the catastrophe was doubly galling because of its
cruel irony. For he was second from the top in the Vortex
Control Laboratory; his life’s work had been a search for
a means or method of extinguishing loose atomic vortices.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His eyes focused vaguely upon the portrait. Wavy
brown hair .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. clear, honest gray eyes .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. lines of character,
of strength and of humor .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. sweetly curved lips,
ready to smile or to kiss.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He wrenched his attention away and scribbled briefly
upon a sheet of paper. Then, getting up stiffly, he took the
portrait and moved woodenly across the room to a furnace.
After the flaming arc had done its work he turned
and handed the paper to a tall man, with a Lens glowing
upon his wrist, who had been watching him with quiet,
understanding eyes. Significant enough, to the initiate, of
the importance of the laboratory is the fact that it was
headed by a Lensman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As of now, Phil, if it’s QX with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Lensman took the document, glanced at it, and
slowly, meticulously, tore it into sixteen equal pieces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Uh-uh, Storm,” he denied, gently. “Not a resignation.
Leave of absence, perhaps, but not severance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?” It was scarcely a question; Cloud’s voice
was level, uninflected. “I wouldn’t be worth the paper I’d
waste.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, no; but the future’s another matter. I haven’t
said anything so far, because I knew you and Jo. Nothing
could be said.” Two hands gripped and held. “For the
future, though, four words that were spoken long ago
have never been improved upon. ‘This, too, shall pass’.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You think so?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know so, Storm. I’ve been round a long time. You’re
too good a man to go down out of control. You’ve got a
place in the world and a job to do. You’ll be back—” a
thought struck the Lensman and he went on, in a strangely
altered tone: “But you wouldn’t—of course you
wouldn’t—you couldn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think so. No.” Suicide, tempting although it
might be, was not the answer. “Good-bye, Phil.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not good-bye, Storm. Au revoir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe.” Cloud left the laboratory and took an elevator
down to the garage. Into his big blue DeKhotinsky
Special and away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Through traffic so heavy that front-, rear-, and side-bumpers
almost touched he drove with his wonted cool
skill; even though he did not know, consciously, that the
other cars were there. He slowed, turned, stopped, “shoveled
on the coal,” all correctly—and all purely automatically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not know where he was going, nor care. His
numbed brain was simply trying to run away from its own
bitter imaginings—which, if he had thought at all, he
would have known hopeless of accomplishment. But he
did not think. He simply acted; dumbly, miserably.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Into a one-way skyway he rocketed; along it over the
suburbs and into the trans-continental super-highway.
Edging inward, lane after lane, he reached the “unlimited”
way—unlimited, that is, except for being limited to
cars of not less than seven hundred horsepower, in perfect
mechanical condition, driven by registered, tested drivers
at not less than one hundred twenty five miles per hour—flashed
his number at the control station, and shoved his
right foot down to the floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Everyone knows that an ordinary DeKhotinsky Sporter
will do a hundred and forty honestly-measured miles in
one honestly-timed hour; but very few drivers have ever
found out how fast one of those brutal big souped-up
Specials can wheel. Most people simply haven’t got what
it takes to open one up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Storm” Cloud found out that day. He held that six-thousand-pound
Juggernaut onto the road, wide open, for
mile after mile after mile. But it didn’t help. Drive as he
would, he could not out-run that which rode with him.
Beside him and within him and behind him; for Jo was
there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jo and the kids, but mostly Jo. It was Jo’s car as much
as it was his. “Babe, the big blue ox,” was her pet name
for it; because, like Paul Bunyan’s fabulous beast, it was
pretty nearly six feet between the eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jo was in the seat beside him. Every dear, every sweet,
every luscious, lovely memory of her was there .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and
behind him, just beyond eye-corner visibility, were the
three kids. And a whole lifetime of this loomed ahead—a
vista of emptiness more vacuous by far than the emptiest
reaches of inter-galactic space. Damnation! he couldn’t
stand much more of.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>High over the roadway, far ahead, a brilliant octagon
flared red. That meant “STOP!” in any language. Cloud
eased up on the accelerator; eased down on the brake-pedal;
took his place in the line of almost-stalled traffic.
There was a barrier and a trimly-uniformed policeman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sorry, sir,” the officer said, with a sweeping, turning
gesture, “but you’ll have to detour over to Twenty. There’s
a loose atomic vortex beside the road up ahead.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Oh,
it’s you, Doctor Cloud! You can go ahead, of course.
Couple of miles yet before you’ll need your armor. They
didn’t tell us they were sending for <span class='it'>you</span>. It’s just a little
new one, and the dope we got was that they were going to
shove it over into the badlands with pressors.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They didn’t send for me.” Cloud tried to smile. “I’m
just driving around. No armor, even, so I might as well go
back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned the Special around. A loose vortex—new.
There might be three or four of them, scattered over that
many counties. Sisters of the one that had murdered his
family—spawn of that damned Number Eleven that that
bungling nitwit had tried to blow out.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Into his mind
there leaped a picture, wire-sharp, of Number Eleven as
he had last seen it, and simultaneously an idea hit him like
the blow of a fist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He thought. <span class='it'>Really</span> thought, now; intensely and clearly.
If he could do it—could actually blow out the atomic
flame of an atomic vortex .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. not exactly revenge, but .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
it <span class='it'>would</span> work .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it would <span class='it'>have</span> to work—he’d <span class='it'>make</span> it
work! And grimly, quietly, but alive now in every fiber, he
drove back to the city almost as fast as he had come
away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If Philip Strong was surprised at Cloud’s sudden reappearance
in the laboratory he did not show it. Nor did he
offer any comment as his erstwhile assistant went to various
lockers and cupboards, assembling coils, tubes, armor,
and other paraphernalia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Guess that’s all I’ll need, chief,” Cloud remarked, finally.
“Here’s a blank check. If some of this stuff shouldn’t
happen to be in usable condition when I get done with it,
fill it out to suit, will you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.” The Lensman tore up the check just as he had
torn up the resignation. “If you want the stuff for legitimate
purposes, you’re on Patrol business and it’s the
Patrol’s risk. But if you’re thinking of trying to snuff a
vortex, the stuff stays here. That’s out, Storm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I’m going to <span class='it'>really</span> snuff ’em, starting with Number
One and taking ’em in order. No suicide.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Huh?” Skepticism incarnate. “It can’t be done, except
by an almost impossibly fortuitous accident, which is why
you yourself have always been as opposed to such attempts
as the rest of us. The charge of explosive must
match, within very narrow limits, the activity of the vortex
itself at the instant of detonation; and that activity
varies so greatly and so unpredictably that all attempts at
accurate extrapolation have failed. Even the Conference
of Scientists couldn’t develop a usable formula, any more
than they could work out a tractor that could be used as a
tow-line on one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait a minute!” Cloud protested. “They found that it
could be forecast, for a length of time proportional to the
length of the cycle in question, by an extension of the
calculus of warped surfaces.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Humph! I said a <span class='it'>usable</span> formula!” the Lensman snorted.
“What good is a ten-second forecast when it takes a
GOMEAC twice that long to solve.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Oh!” he broke off,
staring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” he repeated, slowly. “I forgot for a minute that
you were born with a super-GOMEAC in your head. But
there are other things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There were. Now there are none.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“NO. I couldn’t take such chances before, and I’d’ve
tied myself up into knots if I did. Now nothing can throw
me. I can compute all the elements of a sigma curve in
nothing flat. A ten-second prediction gives me ten seconds
of action. That’s plenty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see.” Strong pondered, his fingers drumming softly
upon his desk. Lensmen did not ordinarily use their Lenses
on their Lensless friends, but this was no ordinary occasion.
“You aren’t afraid of death any more. But you
won’t invite it? And do you mind if I Lens you on that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come in. I’ll not invite it, but that’s as far as I’ll go in
promising. I won’t make any superhuman effort to avoid
it. I’ll take all due precautions, for the sake of the job, but
if one gets me, what the hell?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“QX.” The Lensman withdrew from Cloud’s mind. “Not
too good, but good enough. What’s your plan? You won’t
have time for the usual method of attack.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like this.” Cloud found a sheet of drafting paper and
sketched rapidly. “There’s the crater, with the vortex at
the bottom—there. From the sigma curve I estimate the
most probable value of the activity I’ll have to shoot at.
Then I select three duodec bombs from the hundred or so
I’ll have made up in advance—one on the mark, one each
five percent over and under the mark. The bombs, of
course, will be cased in neocarballoy thick enough for
penetration. Then I take off in a shielded armored flying
suit, say about here.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you take off at all, you and your suit will be inside a
flitter,” the Lensman interrupted. “Too many instruments
for a suit, to say nothing of bombs, and you’ll need
heavier screen than a suit can put out. We can adapt a
flitter for bomb-throwing easily enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’d be better, of course. QX, I set my flitter into a
projectile trajectory toward the center of disturbance.
Twelve seconds away, at about this point here, I take my
instantaneous readings, solve the equations of that particular
warped surface for some definite zero time.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But s’pose the cycle won’t give you a ten-second solution?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I’ll swing around and try again until a long-enough
cycle <span class='it'>does</span> show up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“QX. It will, sometime.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure. Then, having everything set for zero time, and
assuming that the activity is somewhere near my assumed
value.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Assume it isn’t—it probably won’t be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I accelerate or decelerate.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Solving new equations—differential equations at that—all
the while?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly. Don’t interrupt so. I stick around until the
sigma curve, extrapolated to zero time, matches one of my
bombs. I build up the right velocity, cut that bomb loose,
shoot myself off in a sharp curve, and Z-W-E-E-T—POWIE!
She’s out.” With an expressive, sweeping gesture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You hope.” Strong was frankly dubious. “And there
you are, right in the middle of the damndest explosion you
ever saw.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no. I’ve gone free in the meantime, so nothing can
touch me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>I</span> hope! But do you realize just how busy you are going
to be during those ten or twelve seconds?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.” Cloud’s face grew somber. “But I’ll be in full
control. I won’t be afraid of anything that can happen—of
<span class='it'>anything</span> that can happen. From my standpoint, that’s the
hell of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“QX,” the Lensman decided, “You can go. We’ll iron
out the kinks as we go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll be in the lookout shack with the boys, at least on
the first ones. When do you want to start?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How long will it take to fix up the flitter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two days. Say we meet you there Saturday morning?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll be there,” and again Neal Cloud and Babe, the big
blue ox, hit the road; and as he rolled along the physicist
mulled over in his mind the assignment to which he had
set himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Like fire, only worse, atomic energy was a good servant,
but a very bad master. Man had liberated it before
he could really control it. In fact, control was not yet, and
probably never would be, perfect. True, all except a
minute fraction of one percent of the multitudes of small,
tame, self-limiting vortices were perfect servants. But at
long intervals, for some unknown reason—science knew so
little, fundamentally, of nuclear reactions—one of them
flared, nova-like, into a huge, wild, self-sustaining monster.
It ceased being a servant, then, and became a master.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such flare-ups occurred very infrequently; the trouble
was that the loose vortices were so utterly, so damnably
<span class='it'>permanent</span>. They never went out; and no data were ever
obtained. Every living thing in the vicinity of a flare-up
died; every instrument and every other solid thing within a
radius of hundreds of feet melted down into the reeking,
boiling slag of its crater.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fortunately, the rate of growth was slow—as slow,
almost, as it was persistent. But even so, unless something
could be done about loose vortices before too many years,
the situation would become extremely serious. That was
why the Laboratory had been established in the first place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nothing much had been accomplished so far. Tractor
beams would not hold. Nothing material was of any use.
Pressors worked after a fashion—vortices <span class='it'>could</span> be moved
from one place to another. One or two, through sheer
luck, had been blown out by heavy charges of duodecaplylatomate.
But duodec had taken many lives; and since it
scattered a vortex as often as it fed it, duodec had caused
vastly more damage than it had cured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No end of fantastic schemes had been proposed, of
course; of varying degrees of fantasy. Some of them
sounded almost practical. Some of them had been tried;
some were still being tried. Some, such as the perennially-appearing
one of installing a free drive and flinging the
whole neighborhood off into space, were perhaps feasible
from an engineering standpoint. They were potentially so
capable of making things worse, however, that they could
not be used except as last-ditch measures. In short, the
control of loose atomic vortices was very much an unsolved
problem.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='15' id='Page_15'></span><h1 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>Chapter 2</span><br/> ▂▂▂▂▂▂<span style='font-size:larger'>CLOUD BLASTS A VORTEX</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'>NUMBER ONE, the oldest and worst vortex on Tellus,
had been pushed out into the badlands, and there, at eight
o’clock of the indicated morning, Cloud started to work
on it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The “lookout shack” was in fact a fully-equipped nucleonics
laboratory. Its staff was not large—eight men
worked in three staggered eight-hour shifts—but the development
of its instrumentation had required hundreds of
man-years of intensive research. Every factor of the vortex’s
activity was measured and recorded continuously,
throughout every minute of every day of every year; and
all of these measurements were summed up, integrated,
into the “sigma” curve. This curve, which to the layman’s
eye was only a senselessly zig-zagging line, told the expert
everything he wanted to know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cloud glanced at the chart and scowled, for one jagged
peak, less than half an hour old, almost touched the top
line of the paper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bad, huh, Frank?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bad, Storm, and getting worse. I wouldn’t wonder if
‘Calamity’ were right—it certainly looks like she’s getting
ready to blow her top.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No equation, I suppose,” Strong said. The Lensman
ignored as completely as did the observer, if not as flippantly,
the distinct possibility that at any moment the observatory
and all that it contained might be resolved into
their sub-atomic components.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“None,” Cloud stated. He did not need to spend hours
at a calculating machine; at one glance he knew, without
knowing how he knew, that no equation could fit that
wildly-shifting sigma curve. “But most of these recent
cycles cut ordinate seven fifty, so I’ll take that for my
value. That means nine point nine six zero kilograms of
duodec for my basic, and nine four six two and ten point
three five eight as alternates. On the wire?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It went out as you said it,” the observer replied.
“They’ll be here in five minutes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“QX. I’ll get dressed, then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Lensman and one of the observers helped him into
his cumbersome, heavily-padded armor; then all three men
went out to the flitter. A tiny speedster, really; a slim
torpedo with the stubby wings and the ludicrous tail-surfaces,
the multifarious driving-, braking-, side-, top-,
and under-jets so characteristic of the tricky, cranky, but
ultra-maneuverable breed. Cloud checked the newly installed
triplex launcher, made sure that he knew which
bomb was in each tube, and climbed into the tiny operating
compartment. The massive door—flitters are too
small to have airlocks—rammed shut upon its teflon gaskets,
the heavy toggles drove home. A heavily-padded
form closed in upon the pilot, leaving only his left arm
and his right leg free to move.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Everybody in the clear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All clear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cloud shot the flitter into the air and toward the
seething inferno which was Loose Atomic Vortex Number
One. The crater was a ragged, jagged hole perhaps two
miles from lip to lip and a quarter of a mile in depth. The
floor, being largely molten, was almost level except for a
depression at the center, where the actual vortex lay. The
walls of the pit were steeply, unstably irregular, varying in
pitch and shape with the refractoriness of the strata composing
them. Now a section would glare into an unbearably
blinding white, puffing away in sparkling vapor.
Again, cooled by an inrushing blast of air, it would subside
into an angry scarlet, its surface crawling in a sluggish
flow of lava. Occasionally a part of the wall might even go
black, into pockmarked scoriae or brilliant planes of obsidian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For always, at some point or other, there was a torrent
of air rushing into that crater. It rushed in as ordinary air.
It came out, however, in a ragingly uprushing pillar,
as—as something else. No one knows exactly what a
vortex does to air. Or, rather, the composition of the
effluent gases varies as frequently and as unpredictably as
does the activity of the vortex. Thus, the atmosphere
emitted from a vortex-crater may be corrosive, it may be
poisonous, it may be merely different; but it is no longer
the air which we human beings are used to breathing. This
conversion and corruption of Earth’s atmosphere, if it
could not be stopped, would end the possibility of life
upon the planet’s surface long before the world itself
could be consumed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As to the vortex itself .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it is difficult indeed to
describe such a phenomenon. Practically all of its frightful
radiation lies in those octaves of the spectrum which are
invisible to the human eye. Suffice it to say, then, that it
was a continuously active atomic reactor, with an effective
surface temperature of approximately twenty five thousand
degrees Kelvin, and let it go at that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Neal Cloud, driving his flitter through that murky, radiation-riddled
atmosphere, extrapolating his sigma curve by
the sheer power of his mathematical-prodigy’s mind, sat
appalled. For the activity level was, and even in its lowest
dips remained, well above the figure he had chosen. Distant
though he was from the rim of that hellish pit, his
skin began to prickle and to burn. His eyes began to smart
and to ache. He knew what those symptoms meant: even
the flitter’s powerful screens were leaking; even his suit-screens
and his special goggles were not stopping the stuff.
But he wouldn’t quit yet: the activity might—probably
would—take a nose-dive any second now. If it did, he’d
have to be ready. On the other hand, it might blow up any
second, too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were two schools of mathematical thought upon
that point. One held that a vortex, without any essential
change in its nature or behavior, would keep on growing
bigger until, uniting with the other vortices of the planet,
it had converted all the mass of the world into energy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second school, of which the forementioned “Calamity”
Carlowitz was the loudest voice, taught that at a
certain stage of development the internal energy of the
vortex would become so great that generation-radiation
equilibrium could not be maintained. This would of course
result in an explosion, the nature and consequences of
which this Carlowitz was wont to dwell upon in ghoulishly
mathematical glee. Neither school could prove its point,
however—or, rather, each school proved its point with
eminently plausible mathematics—and each hated and derided
the other, with heat and at length.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Neal Cloud, as he studied through his almost opaque
defenses that indescribably ravening fireball, that rapacious
monstrosity which might very well have come
from the very center of the hottest hell of mythology, felt
strangely inclined to agree with Carlowitz. It didn’t seem
possible that it <span class='it'>could</span> get any worse without exploding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The activity stayed high; ’way too high. The tiny control
room grew hotter and hotter. His skin burned more
and his eyes ached worse. He touched a stud and spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Phil? Better get me three more bombs. Like these,
except up around.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t check you. If you do that, it’s apt to drop to a
minimum and stay there. I’d suggest a wider interval.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“QX—that’d be better. Two, then, instead of three.
Four point nine eight zero and thirteen point nine four
zero. You might break out a jar of burn-dressing, too;
some fairly warm stuff is leaking through.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will do. Come down, fast!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cloud landed. He stripped to the skin and his friends
smeared him with the thick, gooey stuff that was not only
added protection against radiation, but also a sovereign
remedy for new burns. He exchanged his goggles for a
heavier, darker pair. The two bombs arrived and were
substituted for two of the original load.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought of something while I was up there,” Cloud
said then. “Fourteen kilograms of duodec is nobody’s
firecracker, but it may be the least of what’s going to go
off. Have you got any idea of what’s going to become of
the intrinsic energy of the vortex when I snuff it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t say I have.” The Lensman frowned in thought.
“No data.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Neither have I. But I’d say you’d better go back to the
new station—the one you were going to move to if it kept
on getting worse. The clocks are ticking there, aren’t
they?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. It might be the smart thing to do—just in case.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again in air, Cloud found that the activity, while still
very high, was not too high for his heaviest bomb, but
that it was fluctuating too rapidly. He could not get even
five seconds of trustworthy prediction, to say nothing of
ten. So he waited, as close to the horrible center of
disintegration as he dared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The flitter hung poised in air, motionless, upon softly
hissing under-jets. Cloud knew to a fraction his height
above the ground. He knew to a fraction his distance from
the vortex. He knew the density of the atmosphere and
the velocity and direction of the wind. Hence, since he
could also read, closely enough, the momentary variations
in the cyclonic storms within the crater, he could compute
very easily the course and velocity necessary to land the
bomb in the exact center of the vortex at any given instant
of time. The hard part—the thing that no one had as yet
succeeded in doing—was to predict, for a time far enough
ahead to be of any use, a usably close approximation to
the vortex’s quantitative activity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Therefore Cloud concentrated upon the dials and
gauges in front of him; concentrated with every fiber of
his being and with every cell of his brain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly, almost imperceptably, the sigma curve gave
signs of flattening out. Cloud’s mind pounced. Simultaneous
differential equations; nine of them. A quadruple integration
in four dimensions. No matter—Cloud did not
solve problems laboriously, one operation at a time. Without
knowing how he had arrived at it, he knew the
answer; just as the Posenian or the Rigellian can perceive
every separate component particle of an opaque, three-dimensional
solid, but without being able to explain to any
Tellurian how his sense of perception works. It just <span class='it'>is</span>,
that’s all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By virtue of whatever sense or ability it is which makes
a mathematical prodigy what he is, Cloud knew that in
exactly seven and three-tenths seconds from that observed
instant the activity of the vortex would match precisely
the rating of his heaviest bomb. Another flick of his
mental switch and he knew exactly the velocity he would
require. His hand swept over the studs, his right foot
tramped down hard upon the firing pedal; and, even as the
quivering flitter rammed forward under five Tellurian gravities
of acceleration, he knew to the thousandth of a
second how long he would have to hold that acceleration
to attain that velocity. While not really long—in seconds—it
was much too long for comfort. It would take him
much closer to the vortex than he wanted to be; in fact, it
would take him almost to the crater’s rim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he stuck to the calculated course, and at the precisely
correct instant he released his largest bomb and cut
his dive. Then, in a continuation of the same motion, his
hand slashed down through the beam of light whose cutting
would activate the Bergenholm and make the vessel
inertialess—safe from any form whatever of physical violence.
For an instant nothing happened, and for that
instant Cloud sat appalled. <span class='it'>Neutralization of inertia took
time!</span> Not that he had ever been told that it was instantaneous—he
had just assumed so. He had never noticed
any time-lapse before, but now it seemed to be taking
forever!</p>

<p class='pindent'>After that one instant of shocked inaction he went into
ultra-speed action; kicking in the little vessel’s all-out eight-G
drive and whirling her around as only a flitter or a
speedster can whirl; only to see in his plate the vortex
opening up like a bell-flower, or like a sun going nova.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cloud’s forebodings were more than materialized then,
for it was not only the bomb that was going off. The
staggeringly immense energy of the vortex was merging
with that of the detonating duodec to form an utterly
indescribable explosion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In part the flood of incandescent lava in the pit was
beaten downward by the sheer, stupendous force of the
blow; in part it was hurled abroad in masses, gouts, and
streamers. And the raging blast of the explosion’s front
seized the fragments and tore and worried them to bits,
hurling them still faster along their paths of violence. And
air, so densely compressed as to act like a solid, smote the
walls of the crater. Those walls crumbled, crushed outward
through the hard-packed ground, broke up into
jaggedly irregular blocks which hurtled screamingly in all
directions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The blast-wave or explosion front buffeted the flyer
while she was still partially inert and while Cloud was
almost blacked out and physically helpless from the frightful
linear and angular accelerations. The impact broke his
left arm and his right leg; the only parts of his body not
pressure-packed. Then, milliseconds later, the debris began
to arrive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Chunks of solid or semi-molten rock slammed against
the hull, knocking off wings and control-surfaces. Gobs of
viscous slag slapped it liquidly, freezing into and clogging
up jets and orifices. The little ship was knocked hither and
thither by forces she could no more resist than can a
floating leaf resist a cataract; Cloud’s brain was addled as
an egg by the vicious concussions which were hitting him
so nearly simultaneously from so many different directions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The concussions and the sluggings lightened .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. stopped
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a vast peace descended, blanket-wise. The flitter was
free—was riding effortlessly away on the outermost, most
tenuous fringes of the storm!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cloud wanted to faint, then, but he didn’t—quite. With
one arm and leg and what few cells of his brain were still
in working order, he was still in the fight. It did not even
occur to him, until long afterward, that he was not going
to make any effort whatever to avoid death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Foggily, he tried to look at the crater. Nine-tenths of
his visiplates were dead, but he finally got a view. Good—it
was out. He wasn’t surprised—he knew it would be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His next effort was to locate the secondary observatory,
where he would have to land; and in that, too, he was
successful. He had enough intelligence left to realize that,
with practically all of his jets clogged and his wings and
tail shot off, he couldn’t land his flitter inert. He’d <span class='it'>have</span> to
land her free.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Neal Cloud was not the world’s best pilot. Nevertheless,
by dint of light and somewhat unorthodox use of what
few jets he had left, he did land her free. A very good
landing, considering—he almost hit the observatory’s field,
which was only one mile square—and having landed her,
he inerted her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, as has been intimated, his brain wasn’t working
quite so good; he had held his ship inertialess for quite a
few seconds longer than he thought, and he did not even
think of the terrific buffetings she had taken. As a result of
these things, however, her intrinsic velocity did not match,
anywhere nearly, that of the ground upon which she lay.
Thus, when Cloud cut his Bergenholm, restoring thereby
to the flitter the absolute velocity and the inertia she had
before going free, there resulted a distinctly anticlimactic
crash.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a last terrific bump as the motionless vessel
collided with the equally motionless ground; and “Storm”
Cloud, Vortex Blaster, went out like the proverbial light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Help came, of course; on the double. Cloud was unconscious
and the flitter’s port could not be opened from the
outside, but those were not insuperable obstacles. A plate,
already loose, was torn away; the pilot was unclamped
and rushed to Base Hospital in the “meat-crate” standing
by.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Later, in a private office of that hospital, the head of
the Vortex Control Laboratory sat and waited—not patiently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How is he, Lacy?” he demanded, as the surgeon-marshal
entered the room. “He’s going to live?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, Phil—definitely yes,” Lacy replied, briskly. “A
very good skeleton; very good indeed. His screens stopped
all the really bad radiation, so the damage will yield quite
readily to treatment. He doesn’t really need the Phillips
we gave him—for the replacement of damaged parts, you
know—except for a few torn muscles and so on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But he was pretty badly smashed up—I helped take
him out, you know—how about that arm and leg? He was
a mess.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Merely simple fractures—entirely negligible.” Lacy
waved aside with an airy gesture such minor ills as broken
bones. “He’ll be out in a couple of weeks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How soon can I see him? Business can wait, but there’s
a personal matter that can’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know what you mean.” Lacy pursed his lips. “Ordinarily
I wouldn’t allow it, but you see him now. Not
too long, though, Phil; he’s weak. Ten minutes at most.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“QX. Thanks.” A nurse led the visiting Lensman to
Cloud’s bedside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hi, stupe!” he boomed, cheerfully. “ ‘Stupe’ being short
for ‘stupendous’, this time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ho, chief. Glad to see somebody. Sit down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re the most-wanted man in the galaxy, not excepting
Kimball Kinnison. Here’s a spool of tape, which you
can look at as soon as Lacy will let you have a scanner.
It’s only the first one. As soon as any planet finds out that
we’ve got a sure-enough-vortex-blower-outer who can really
call his shots—and <span class='it'>that</span> news gets around mighty
fast—it sends in a double-urgent, Class A Prime demand
for you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sirius IV got in first by a whisker, but it was a photo
finish with Aldebaran II and all channels have been
jammed ever since. Canopus, Vega, Rigel, Spica. Everybody,
from Alsakan to Zabriska. We announced right off
that we wouldn’t receive personal delegations—we had to
almost throw a couple of pink-haired Chickladorians out
bodily to make them believe we meant it—that our own
evaluation of necessity, not priority of requisition, would
govern. QX?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Absolutely,” Cloud agreed. “That’s the only way to
handle it, I should think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So forget this psychic trauma.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. No, I don’t mean
that,” the Lensman corrected himself hastily. “You know
what I mean. The will to live is the most important factor
in any man’s recovery, and too many worlds need you too
badly to have you quit now. Check?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose so,” Cloud acquiesced, but somberly, “and
I’ve got more will to live than I thought I had. I’ll keep on
pecking away as long as I last.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you’ll die of old age, Buster,” the Lensman
assured him. “We got full data. We know exactly how
long it takes to go from fully inert to fully free. We know
exactly what to do to your screens. Next time nothing will
come through except light, and only as much of that as
you like. You can wait as close to a vortex as you please,
for as long as is necessary to get exactly the conditions
you want. You’ll be as safe as if you were in Klono’s hip
pocket.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure of that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Absolutely—or at least, as sure as we can be of anything
that hasn’t happened yet. But your guardian angel
here is eyeing her clock a bit pointedly, so I’d better do a
flit before she tosses me out on my ear. Clear ether,
Storm!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Clear ether, chief!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus “Storm” Cloud, nucleonicist, became the most
narrowly-specialized specialist in the long annals of
science; became “Storm” Cloud, the Vortex Blaster.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And that night Lensman Philip Strong, instead of sleeping,
thought and thought and thought. What could he
do—what could <span class='it'>anybody</span> do—if Cloud should get himself
killed? <span class='it'>Somebody</span> would have to do <span class='it'>something</span> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but
who? And what? Could—or could not—another Vortex
Blaster be found? Or trained?</p>

<p class='pindent'>And next morning, early, he Lensed a thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kinnison? Phil Strong. I’ve got a high-priority problem
that will take a lot of work and a lot more weight than I
carry. Are you free to listen for a few minutes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m free. Go ahead.”</p>

<p class='noindent'>TELLURIAN PHARMACEUTICALS, INC., was Civilization’s
oldest and most conservative drug house. “Hide-bound”
was the term most frequently used, not only by its
younger employees, but also by its more progressive competitors.
But, corporatively, Tellurian Pharmaceuticals,
Inc., did not care. Its board of directors was limited by an
iron-clad, if unwritten, law to men of seventy years
more; and against the inertia of that ruling body the
impetuosity of the younger generation was exactly as
efficacious as the dashing of ocean waves against an adamantine
cliff—and in very much the same fashion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ocean waves do in time cut into even the hardest rock;
and, every century or two, TPI did take forward step—after
a hundred years of testing by others had proved
conclusively that the “new” idea conformed in every particular
with the exalted standards of the Galactic Medical
Association.</p>

<p class='pindent'>TPI’s plant upon the planet Deka (Dekanore III, on the
charts) filled the valley of Clear Creek and the steep, high
hills on its sides, from the mountain spring which was the
creek’s source to its confluence with the Spokane River.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The valley floor was a riot of color, devoted as it was to
the intensive cultivation of medicinal plants. Along both
edges of the valley extended row after row of hydroponics
sheds. Upon the mountains’ sides there were snake dens,
lizard pens, and enclosures for many other species of
fauna.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor was the surface all that was in use. The hills were
hollow: honeycombed into hundreds of rooms in which,
under precisely controlled environments of temperature,
atmosphere, and radiation, were grown hundreds of widely-variant
forms of life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the confluence of creek and river, just inside the city
limits of Newspoke—originally New Spokane—there
reared and sprawled the Company’s headquarters buildings;
offices, processing and synthesizing plants, laboratories,
and so on. In one of the laboratories, three levels
below ground, two men faced each other. Works Manager
Graves was tall and fat; Fenton V. Fairchild, M.D.,
Nu.D., F.C.R., Consultant in Radiation, was tall and thin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Everything set, Graves?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Twelve hours, you said.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For the full cycle. Seven to the point of maximum
yield.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go ahead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here are the seeds. Treconian broadleaf. For the
present you will have to take my word for it that they did
not come from Trenco. These are standard hydroponics
tanks, size one. The formula of the nutrient solution, while
complex and highly critical, contains nothing either rare
or unduly expensive. I plant the seed, thus, in each of the
two tanks. I cover each tank with a plastic hood, transparent
to the frequencies to be used. I cover both with a
larger hood—so. I align the projectors—thus. We will now
put on armor, as the radiation is severe and the atmosphere,
of which there may be leakage when the pollenating
blast is turned on, is more than slightly toxic. I then
admit Trenconian atmosphere from this cylinder.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Synthetic or imported?” Graves interrupted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Imported. Synthesis is possible, but prohibitively expensive
and difficult. Importation in tankers is simple and
comparatively cheap. I now energize the projectors.
Growth has begun.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the glare of blue-green radiance the atmosphere
inside the hoods, the very ether, warped and writhed. In
spite of the distortion of vision, however, it could be seen
that growth was taking place, and at an astounding rate.
In a few minutes the seeds had sprouted; in an hour the
thick, broad, purplish-green leaves were inches long. In
seven hours each tank was full of a lushly luxuriant tangle
of foliage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is the point of maximum yield,” Fairchild remarked,
as he shut off the projectors. “We will now
process one tank, if you like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly I like. How else could I know it’s the clear
quill?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the looks,” came the scientist’s dry rejoinder. “Pick
your tank.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>One tank was removed. The leaves were processed. The
full cycle of growth of the remaining tank was completed.
Graves himself harvested the seeds, and himself carried
them away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Six days, six samples, six generations of seed, and the
eminently skeptical Graves was convinced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve got something there, Doc,” he admitted then.
“We can really go to town on that. Now, how about
notes, or stuff from your old place, or people who may
have smelled a rat?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m perfectly clean. None of my boys know anything
important, and none ever will. I assemble all apparatus
myself, from standard parts, and disassemble it myself.
I’ve been around, Graves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we can’t be too sure.” The fat man’s eyes were
piercing and cold. “Leakers don’t live very long. We don’t
want you to die, at least not until we get in production
here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nor then, if you know when you’re well off,” the
scientist countered, cynically. “I’m a fellow of the College
of Radiation, and it took me five years to learn this
technique. None of your hatchetmen could <span class='it'>ever</span> learn it.
Remember that, my friend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So don’t get off on the wrong foot and don’t get any
funny ideas. I know how to run things like this and I’ve
got the manpower and equipment to do it. If I come in
I’m running it, not you. Take it or leave it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fat man pondered for minutes, then decided. “I’ll
take it. You’re in, Doc. You can have a cave—two hundred
seventeen is empty—and we’ll go up and get things
started right now.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='pindent'>Less than a year later, the same two men sat in Graves’
office. They waited while a red light upon a peculiarly
complicated deskboard faded through pink into pure
white.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All clear. This way, Doc.” Graves pushed a yellow
button on his desk and a section of blank wall slid aside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the elevator thus revealed the two men went down to
a sub-basement. Along a dimly-lit corridor, through an
elaborately locked steel door, and into a steel-lined room.
Four inert bodies lay upon the floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Graves thrust a key into an orifice and a plate swung
open, revealing a chute into which the bodies were
dumped. The two retraced their steps to the manager’s
office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, that’s all we can feed to the disintegrator.”
Fairchild lit an Alsakanite cigarette and exhaled appreciatively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why? Going soft on us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. The ice is getting too thin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whaddya mean, ‘thin’?” Graves demanded. “The Patrol
inspectors are ours—all that count. Our records are
fixed. Everything’s on the green.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what <span class='it'>you</span> think,” the scientist sneered. “You’re
supposed to be smart. Are you? Our accident rate is up
three hundredths; industrial hazard rate and employee
turnover about three and a half; and the Narcotics Division
alone knows how much we have upped total bootleg
sales. Those figures are all in the Patrol’s books. How can
you give such facts the brush-off?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We don’t have to.” Graves laughed comfortably.
“Even a half of one percent wouldn’t excite suspicion. Our
distribution is so uniform throughout the galaxy that they
can’t center it. They can’t possibly trace anything back to
us. Besides, with our lily-white reputation, other firms
would get knocked off in time to give us plenty of warning.
Lutzenschiffer’s, for instance, is putting out Heroin by
the ton.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So what?” Fairchild remained entirely unconvinced.
“Nobody else is putting out what comes out of cave two
seventeen—demand and price prove that. What you don’t
seem to get, Graves, is that some of those damned Lensmen
have <span class='it'>brains</span>. Suppose they decide to put a couple of
Lensmen onto this job—then what? The minute anybody
runs a rigid statistical analysis on us, we’re done for.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Um .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. m.” This was a distinctly disquieting thought,
in view of the impossibility of concealing anything from a
Lensman who was really on the prowl. “That wouldn’t be
so good. What would you do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d shut down two seventeen—and the whole hush-hush
end—until we can get our records straight and our
death-rate down to the old ten-year average. That’s the
only way we can be really safe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shut down! The way they’re pushing us for production?
Don’t be an idiot—the chief would toss us both
down the chute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I don’t mean without permission. Talk him into it.
It’d be best for everybody, over the long pull, believe
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a chance. He’d blow his stack. If we can’t dope
out something better than that, we go on as is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The next-best thing would be to use some new form of
death to clean up our books.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wonderful!” Graves snorted contemptuously. “What
would we add to what we’ve got now—bubonic plague?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A loose atomic vortex.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wh-o-o-o-sh!” The fat man deflated, then came back
up, gasping for air. “Man, you’re completely <span class='it'>nuts</span>! There’s
only one on the planet, and it’s .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or do you mean .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
but <span class='it'>nobody</span> ever touched one of those things off deliberately
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. can it be done?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. It isn’t simple, but we of the College of Radiation
know how—theoretically—the transformation can be
made to occur. It has never been done because it has been
impossible to extinguish the things; but now Neal Cloud is
putting them out. The fact that the idea is new makes it
all the better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll say so. Neat .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <span class='it'>very</span> neat.” Graves’ agile and
cunning brain figuratively licked its chops. “Certain of our
employees will presumably have been upon an outing in
the upper end of the valley when this terrible accident
takes place?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exactly—enough of them to straighten out our books.
Then, later, we can dispose of undesirables as they appear.
Vortices are absolutely unpredictable, you know.
People can die of radiation or of any one of a mixture of
various toxic gases and the vortex will take the blame.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And later on, when it gets dangerous, Storm Cloud can
blow it out for us,” Graves gloated. “But we won’t want
him for a long, long time!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, but we’ll report it and ask for him the hour it
happens .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. use your head, Graves!” He silenced the
manager’s anguished howl of protest. “Anybody who gets
one wants it killed as soon as possible, but here’s the
joker. Cloud has enough Class-A-double-prime-urgent demands
on file already to keep him busy from now on, so
we won’t be able to get him for a long, long time. See?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see. Nice, Doc .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. very, <span class='it'>very</span> nice. But I’ll have the
boys keep an eye on Cloud just the same.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='pindent'>At about this same time two minor cogs of TPI’s vast
machine sat blissfully, arms around each other, on a rustic
seat improvised from rocks, branches, and leaves. Below
them, almost under their feet, was a den of highly venemous
snakes, but neither man or girl saw them. Before
them, also unperceived, was a magnificent view of valley
and stream and mountain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All they saw, however, was each other—until their
attention was wrenched to a man who was climbing
toward them with the aid of a thick club which he used as
a staff.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Bob!” The girl stared briefly; then, with a
half-articulate moan, shrank even closer against her lover’s
side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ryder, left arm tightening around the girl’s waist, felt
with his right hand for a club of his own and tensed his
muscles, for the climbing man was completely mad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His breathing was .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. horrible. Mouth tight-clamped,
despite his terrific exertion, he was <span class='it'>sniffing</span>—sniffing loathsomely,
lustfully, each whistling inhalation filling his lungs
to bursting. He exhaled explosively, as though begrudging
the second of time required to empty himself of air.
Wide-open eyes glaring fixedly ahead he blundered upward,
paying no attention whatever to his path. He tore
through clumps of thorny growth; he stumbled and fell
over logs and stones; he caromed away from boulders; as
careless of the needles which tore clothing and skin as of
the rocks which bruised his flesh to the bone. He struck a
great tree and bounced; felt his frenzied way around the
obstacle and back into his original line.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He struck the gate of the pen immediately beneath the
two appalled watchers and stopped. He moved to the right
and paused, whimpering in anxious agony. Back to the
gate and over to the left, where he stopped and howled.
Whatever the frightful compulsion was, whatever he
sought, he could not deviate enough from his line to go
around the pen. He looked, then, and for the first time
saw the gate and the fence and the ophidian inhabitants of
the den. They did not matter. Nothing mattered. He
fumbled at the lock, then furiously attacked it and the
gate and the fence with his club—fruitlessly. He tried to
climb the fence, but failed. He tore off his shoes and socks
and, by dint of jamming toes and fingers ruthlessly into
the meshes, he began to climb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No more than he had minded the thorns and the rocks
did he mind the eight strands of viciously-barbed wire
surmounting that fence; he did not wince as the inch-long
steel fangs bit into arms and legs and body. He did,
however, watch the snakes. He took pains to drop into an
area temporarily clear of them, and he pounded to death
the half-dozen serpents bold enough to bar his path.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, dropping to the ground, he writhed and scuttled
about; sniffing ever harder; nose plowing the ground. He
halted; dug his bleeding fingers into the hard soil; thrust
his nose into the hole; inhaled tremendously. His body
writhed, trembled, shuddered uncontrollably, then stiffened
convulsively into a supremely ecstatic rigidity utterly horrible
to see.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The terribly labored breathing ceased. The body collapsed
bonelessly, even before the snakes crawled up and
struck and struck and struck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jacqueline Comstock saw very little of the outrageous
performance. She screamed once, shut both eyes, and,
twisting about within the man’s encircling arm, burrowed
her face into his left shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ryder, however—white-faced, set-jawed, sweating—watched
the thing to its ghastly end. When it was over he
licked his lips and swallowed twice before he could speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all over, dear—no danger now,” he managed finally
to say. “We’d better go. We ought to turn in an alarm
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. make a report or something.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I can’t, Bob—I can’t!” she sobbed. “If I open my
eyes I just know I’ll look, and if I look I’ll .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I’ll simply
turn inside out!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hold everything, Jackie! Keep your eyes shut. I’ll pilot
you and tell you when we’re out of sight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>More than half carrying his companion, Ryder set off
down the rocky trail. Out of sight of what had happened,
the girl opened her eyes and they continued their descent
in a more usual, more decorous fashion until they met a
man hurrying upward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Dr. Fairchild! There was a.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” But the report
which Ryder was about to make was unnecessary; the
alarm had already been given.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know,” the scientist puffed. “Stop! Stay exactly where
you are!” He jabbed a finger emphatically downward to
anchor the young couple in the spot they occupied. “Don’t
talk—don’t say a word until I get back!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fairchild returned after a time, unhurried and completely
at ease. He did not ask the shaken couple if they
had seen what had happened. He knew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bu .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. buh .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but, doctor,” Ryder began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Keep still—don’t talk at all.” Fairchild ordered, bruskly.
Then, in an ordinary conversational tone, he went on:
“Until we have investigated this extraordinary occurrence
thoroughly—sifted it to the bottom—the possibility of
sabotage and spying cannot be disregarded. As the only
eye-witnesses, your reports will be exceedingly valuable;
but you must not say a word until we are in a place which
I <span class='it'>know</span> is proof against any and all spy-rays. Do you
understand?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! Yes, we understand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pull yourselves together, then. Act unconcerned, casual;
particularly when we get to the Administration Building.
Talk about the weather—or, better yet, about the
honeymoon you are going to take on Chickladoria.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus there was nothing visibly unusual about the group
of three which strolled into the building and into Graves’
private office. The fat man raised an eyebrow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m taking them to the private laboratory,” Fairchild
said, as he touched the yellow button and led the two
toward the private elevator. “Frankly, young folks, I am a
scared—yes, a badly scared man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This statement, so true and yet so misleading, resolved
the young couple’s inchoate doubts. Entirely unsuspectingly,
they followed the Senior Radiationist into the elevator
and, after it had stopped, along, a corridor. They paused
as he unlocked and opened a door; they stepped unquestioningly
into the room at his gesture. He did not, however,
follow them in. Instead, the heavy metal slab slammed
shut, cutting off Jackie’s piercing shriek of fear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You might as well cut out the racket,” came from a
speaker in the steel ceiling of the room. “Nobody can hear
you but me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But Mr. Graves, I thought .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Dr. Fairchild told us
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we were going to tell him about.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re going to tell nobody nothing. You saw too
much and know too much, that’s all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, <span class='it'>that’s</span> it!” Ryder’s mind reeled as some part of the
actual significance of what he had seen struck home. “But
listen! Jackie didn’t see anything—she had her eyes shut
all the time—and doesn’t know anything. You don’t want
to have the murder of such a girl as <span class='it'>she</span> is on your mind, I
know. Let her go and she’ll never say a word—we’ll both
swear to it—or you could.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why? Just because she’s got a face and a shape?” The
fat man sneered. “No soap, Junior. She’s not that much of
a.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” He broke off as Fairchild entered his office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, how about it? How bad is it?” Graves
demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not bad at all. Everything’s under control.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen, doctor!” Ryder pleaded. “Surely you don’t want
to murder Jackie here in cold blood? I was just suggesting
to Graves that he could get a therapist.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Save your breath,” Fairchild ordered. “We have important
things to think about. You two die.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why?” Ryder cried. He could as yet perceive only
a fraction of the tremendous truth. “I tell you, it’s.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll let you guess,” said Fairchild.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shock upon shock had been too much for the girl’s
overstrained nerves. She fainted quietly and Ryder eased
her down to the cold steel floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t you give her a better cell than this?” he protested
then. “There’s no .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it isn’t <span class='it'>decent</span>!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll find food and water, and that’s enough.” Graves
laughed coarsely. “You won’t live long, so don’t worry
about conveniences. But keep still. If you want to know
what’s going on, you can listen, but one more word out of
you and I cut the circuit. Go ahead, Doc, with what you
were going to say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was a fault in the rock. Very small, but a little
of the finest smoke seeped through. Barney must have
been a sniffer before to be able to smell the trace of the
stuff that was drifting down the hill. I’m having the whole
cave tested with a leak-detector and sealed bottle-tight.
The record can stand it that Barney—he was a snake-tender,
you know—died of snake-bite. That’s almost the
truth, too, by the way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fair enough. Now, how about these two?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Um .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. m. We’ve got to hold the risk at absolute
minimum.” Fairchild pondered briefly. “We can’t disintegrate
them this month, that’s sure. They’ve got to be
found dead, and our books are full. We’ll have to keep
them alive—where they are now is as good a place as
any—for a week.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why alive? We’ve kept stiffs in cold storage before
now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Too chancey. Dead tissues change too much. You
weren’t courting investigation then; now we are. We’ve
got to keep our noses clean. How about this? They
couldn’t wait any longer and got married today. You,
big-hearted philanthropist that you are, told them they
could take their two weeks vacation now for a honeymoon—you’d
square it with their department heads. They
come back in about ten days, to get settled; go up the
valley to see the vortex; and out. Anything in that set-up
we can’t fake a cover for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It looks perfect to me. We’ll let ’em enjoy life for ten
days, right where they are now. Hear that, Ryder?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, you pot-bellied.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fat man snapped a switch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is not necessary to go into the details of the imprisonment.
Doggedly and skillfully though he tried, Ryder
could open up no avenue of escape or of communication;
and Jacqueline, facing the inevitability of death, steadied
down to meet it. She was a woman. In minor crises she
had shrieked and had hidden her face and had fainted:
but in this ultimate one she drew from the depths of her
woman’s soul not only the power to overcome her own
weakness, but also an extra something with which to
sustain and fortify her man.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='34' id='Page_34'></span><h1 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>Chapter 4</span><br/> ▂▂▂▂▂▂<span style='font-size:larger'>“STORM” CLOUD ON DEKA</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'>IN THE VORTEX CONTROL LABORATORY on Tellus,
Cloud had just gone into Philip Strong’s office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No trouble?” the Lensman asked, after greetings had
been exchanged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Uh-huh. Simple as blowing out a match. You quit
worrying about me long ago, didn’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pretty much, except for the impossibility of training
anybody else to do it. We’re still working on that angle,
though. You’re looking fit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was. He carried no scars—the Phillips treatment
had taken care of that. His face looked young and keen;
his hard-schooled, resilient body was in surprisingly fine
condition for that of a man crowding forty so nearly. He
no longer wore his psychic trauma visibly; it no longer
obtruded itself between him and those with whom he
worked; but in his own mind he was <span class='it'>sure</span> that it still was,
and always would be, there. But the Lensman, studying
him narrowly—and, if the truth must be known, using his
Lens as well—was <span class='it'>not</span> sure, and was well content.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not bad for an old man, Phil. I could whip a wildcat,
and spot him one bite and two scratches. But what I came
in here for, as you may have suspected, is—where do I go
from here? Spica or Rigel or Canopus? They’re the worst,
aren’t they?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rigel’s is probably the worst in property damage and
urgency. Before we decide, though, I wish you’d take a
good look at this data from Dekanore III. See if you see
what I do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Huh? Dekanore III?” Cloud was surprised. “No trouble
there, is there? They’ve only got one, and it’s ’way
down in Class Z somewhere.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two now. It’s the new one I’m talking about. It’s
acting funny—<span class='it'>damned</span> funny.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cloud went through the data, brow furrowed in concentration;
then sketched three charts and frowned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see what you mean. ‘<span class='it'>Damned</span> funny’ is right. The
toxicity is too steady, but at the same time the composition
of the effluvium is too varied. Inconsistent. However,
there’s no real attempt at a gamma analysis—nowhere
near enough data for one—this <span class='it'>could</span> be right; they’re so
utterly unpredictable. The observers were inexperienced, I
take it, with medical and chemical bias?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Check. That’s the way I read it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’ll say this much—I never saw a gamma chart
that would accept half of this stuff, and I can’t even
imagine what the sigma curve would look like. Boss, what
say I skip over there and get us a full reading on that baby
before she goes orthodox—or, should I say, orthodoxly
unorthodox?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“However you say it, that’s my thought exactly; and we
have a good excuse for giving it priority. It’s killing more
people than all three of the bad ones together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I can’t fix the toxicity with exciters I’ll throw a solid
cordon around it to keep people away. I won’t blow it
out, though, until I find out why it’s acting so—if it is.
Clear ether, chief, I’m practically there!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It did not take long to load Cloud’s flitter aboard a
Dekanore-bound liner. Half-way there however, an alarm
rang out and the dread word “Pirates!” resounded through
the ship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Consternation reigned, for organized piracy had disappeared
with the fall of the Council of Boskone. Furthermore,
this was not in any sense a treasure ship; she was an
ordinary passenger liner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had had little enough warning—her communications
officer had sent out only a part of his first distress
call when the blanketing interference jammed his channels.
The pirate—a first-class superdreadnought—flashed
up and a visual beam drove in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go inert,” came the terse command. “We’re coming
aboard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you completely crazy?” The liner’s captain was
surprised and disgusted, rather than alarmed. “If not,
you’ve got the wrong ship. Everything aboard—including
any ransom you could get for our passenger list—wouldn’t
pay your expenses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You wouldn’t know, of course, that you’re carrying a
package of Lonabarian jewelry, or would you?” The question
was elaborately skeptical.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know damned well I’m <span class='it'>not</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll take the package you <span class='it'>haven’t</span> got, then!” the
pirate snapped. “Go inert and open up, or I’ll do it for
you—like this.” A needle-beam lashed out and expired.
“That was through one of your holds. The next one will
be through your control room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Resistance being out of the question, the liner went
inert. While the intrinsic velocities of the two vessels were
being matched, the pirate issued further instructions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All officers now in the control room, stay there. All
other officers, round up all passengers and herd them into
the main saloon. Anybody that acts up or doesn’t do
exactly what he’s told will be blasted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pirates boarded. One squad went to the control
room. Its leader, seeing that the communications officer
was still trying to drive a call through the blanket of
interference, beamed him down without a word. At this
murder the captain and four or five other officers went for
their guns and there was a brief but bloody battle. There
were too many pirates.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A larger group invaded the main saloon. Most of them
went through, only half a dozen or so posting themselves
to guard the passengers. One of the guards, a hook-nosed
individual wearing consciously an aura of authority,
spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take it easy, folks, and nobody’ll get hurt. If any of
you’ve got guns, don’t go for ’em. That’s a specialty that.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of his DeLameters flamed briefly. Cloud’s right
arm, almost to the shoulder, vanished. The man behind
him dropped—in two different places.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take it easy, I said,” the pirate chief went calmly on.
“You can tie that arm up, fella, if you want to. It was in
line with that guy who was trying to pull a gun. You
nurse over there—take him to sick-bay and fix up his
wing. If anybody stops you tell ’em Number One said to.
Now, the rest of you, watch your step. I’ll cut down every
damn one of you that so much as looks like he wanted to
start something.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They obeyed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a few minutes the looting parties returned to the
saloon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you get it, Six?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yeah. In the mail, like you said.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The safe?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure. Wasn’t much in it, but not too bad, at that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“QX. Control room! QX?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ten dead,” the intercom blatted in reply. “Otherwise
QX.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fuse the panels?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Natch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s go!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went. Their vessel flashed away. The passengers
rushed to their staterooms. Then:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doctor Cloud!” came from the speaker. “Doctor Neal
Cloud! Control room calling Doctor Cloud!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cloud speaking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Report to the control room, please.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh—excuse me—I didn’t know you were wounded,”
the officer apologized as he saw the bandaged stump and
the white, sweating face. “You’d better go to bed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doing nothing wouldn’t help. What did you want me
for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know anything about communicators?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A little—what a nucleonics man has to know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good. They killed all our communications officers and
blasted the panels, even in the lifeboats. You can’t do
much with your left hand, of course, but you may be able
to boss the job of rigging up a spare.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can do more than you think—I’m left-handed. Give
me a couple of technicians and I’ll see what we can do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They set to work, but before they could accomplish
anything a cruiser drove up, flashing its identification as a
warship of the Galactic Patrol.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We picked up the partial call you got off,” its young
commander said, briskly. “With that and the plotted center
of interference we didn’t lose any time. Let’s make this
snappy.” He was itching to be off after the marauder, but
he could not leave until he had ascertained the facts and
had been given clearance. “You aren’t hurt much—don’t
need to call a tug, do you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” replied the liner’s senior surviving officer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“QX,” and a quick investigation followed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anybody who ships stuff like that open mail ought to
lose it, but it’s tough on innocent bystanders. Anything else
I can do for you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not unless you can lend us some officers, particularly
navigators and communications officers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sorry, but we’re short there ourselves—four of my
best are in sick-bay. Sign this clearance, please, and I’ll get
on that fellow’s tail. I’ll send your copy of my report to
your head office. Clear ether!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cruiser shot away. Temporary repairs were made
and the liner, with Cloud and a couple of electronics
technicians as communications officers, finished the voyage
to Dekanore III without more interruption.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Vortex Blaster was met at the dock by Works
Manager Graves himself. The fat man was effusively sorry
that Cloud had lost an arm, but assured him that the
accident wouldn’t lay him up very long. He, Graves,
would get a Posenian surgeon over here so fast that.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If the manager was taken aback to learn that Cloud
had already had a Phillips treatment, he did not show it.
He escorted the specialist to Deka’s best hotel, where he
introduced him largely and volubly. Graves took him to
supper. Graves took him to a theater and showed him the
town. Graves told the hotel management to give the
scientist the best rooms and the best valet they had, and
that Cloud was not to be allowed to spend any of his own
money. All of his activities, whatever their nature, purpose,
or extent, were to be charged to Tellurian Pharmaceuticals,
Inc. Graves was a grand guy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cloud broke loose, finally, and went to the dock to see
about getting his flitter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It had not been unloaded. There would be a slight
delay, he was informed, because of the insurance inspections
necessitated by the damage—and Cloud had not
known that there had been any! When he had learned
what had been done to his little ship he swore bitterly and
sought out the liner’s senior officer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why didn’t you tell me we got holed?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, I don’t know .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. just that you didn’t ask, is all, I
guess. I don’t suppose it occurred to anybody—I know it
didn’t to me—that you might be interested.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And that was, Cloud knew, strictly true. Passengers
were not informed of such occurrences. He had been
enough of an officer so that he could have learned anything
he wished; but not enough of one to have been
informed of such matters as routine. Nor was it surprising
that it had not come up in conversation. Damage to cargo
meant nothing whatever to the liner’s overworked officers,
standing double watches; a couple of easily-patched holes
in the hull were not worth mentioning. From their standpoint
the <span class='it'>only</span> damage was done to the communicators,
and Cloud himself had set them to rights. This delay was
his own fault as much as anybody else’s. Yes, more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You won’t lose anything, though,” the officer said,
helpfully. “Everything’s covered, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t the money I’m yowling about—it’s the time.
That apparatus can’t be duplicated anywhere except on
Tellus, and even there it’s all special-order stuff. OH,
DAMN!” and Cloud strode away toward his hotel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the following days TPI entertained him royally.
Not insistently—Graves was an expert in such matters—but
simply by giving him the keys to the planet. He could
do anything he pleased. He could have all the company he
wanted, male or female, to help him to do it. Thus he
did—within limits—just about what Graves wanted him to
do; and, in spite of the fact that he did not want to enjoy
life, he liked it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One evening, however, he refused to play a slot machine,
explaining to his laughing companion that the laws
of chance were pretty thoroughly shackled in such
mechanisms—and the idle remark backfired. What was
the mathematical probability that all the things that had
happened to him could have happened by pure chance?</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night he analyzed his data. Six incidents; the
probability was extremely small. Seven, if he counted his
arm. If it had been his <span class='it'>left</span> arm—jet back! Since he wrote
with his right hand, very few people knew that he was
left-handed. Seven it was; and that made it virtually certain.
Accident was out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But if he <span class='it'>was</span> being delayed and hampered deliberately,
who was doing it, and why? It didn’t make sense. Nevertheless,
the idea would not down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was a trained observer and an analyst second to
none. Therefore he soon found out that he was being
shadowed wherever he went, but he could not get any
really significant leads. Wherefore:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Graves, have you got a spy-ray detector?” he asked
boldly—and watchfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fat man did not turn a hair. “No, nobody would
want to spy on me. Why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I feel jumpy. I don’t know why anybody would be
spying on me, either, but—I’m neither a Lensman nor an
esper, but I’d swear that somebody’s peeking over my
shoulder half the time. I think I’ll go over to the Patrol
station and borrow one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nerves, my boy; nerves and shock,” Graves diagnosed.
“Losing an arm would shock hell out of anybody’s nervous
system, I’d say. Maybe the Phillips treatment—the new
one growing on—sort of pulls you out of shape.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Could be,” Cloud assented, moodily. His act had been
a flop. If Graves knew anything—and he’d be damned if
he could see any grounds for such a suspicion—he hadn’t
given away a thing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nevertheless, Cloud went to the Patrol office, which
was of course completely and permanently shielded. There
he borrowed the detector and asked the lieutenant in
charge to get a special report from the Patrol upon the
alleged gems and what it knew about either the cruiser or
the pirates. To justify his request he had to explain his
suspicions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the messages had been sent the young officer
drummed thoughtfully upon his desk. “I wish I could do
something, Dr. Cloud, but I don’t see how I can,” he
decided finally. “Without a shred of evidence, I <span class='it'>can’t</span> act.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know. I’m not accusing anybody, yet. It may be
anybody between here and Andromeda. Just call me,
please, as soon as you get that report.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The report came, and the Patrolman was round-eyed as
he imparted the information, that, as far as Prime Base
could discover, there had been no Lonabarian gems and
the rescuing vessel had not been a Patrol ship at all. Cloud
was not surprised.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought so,” he said, flatly. “This is a hell of a thing
to say, but it now becomes a virtual certainty—six sigmas
out on the probability curve—that this whole fantastic
procedure was designed solely to keep me from analyzing
and blowing out that new vortex. As to where the vortex
fits in, I haven’t got even the dimmest possible idea, but
one thing is clear. Graves represents TPI—on this planet
he <span class='it'>is</span> TPI. Now what kind of monkey-business would
TPI—or, more likely, somebody working under cover <span class='it'>in</span>
TPI, because undoubtedly the head office doesn’t know
anything about it—be doing? I ask you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dope, you mean? Cocaine—heroin—that kind of
stuff?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exactly; and here’s what I’m going to do about it.”
Bending over the desk, even in that ultra-shielded office,
Cloud whispered busily for minutes. “Pass this along to
Prime Base immediately, have them alert Narcotics, and
have your men ready in case I strike something hot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But listen, man!” the Patrolman protested. “Wait—let
a Lensman do it. They’ll almost certainly catch you at it,
and if they’re clean <span class='it'>nothing</span> can keep you from doing
ninety days in the clink.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But if we wait, the chances are it’ll be too late; they’ll
have had time to cover up. What I’m asking you is, will
you back my play if I catch them with the goods?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. We’ll be here, armored and ready. But I still
think you’re nuts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe so, but even if my mathematics is wrong, it’s
still a fact that my arm will grow back on just as fast in
the clink as anywhere else. Clear ether, lieutenant—until
tonight!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cloud made an engagement with Graves for luncheon.
Arriving a few minutes early, he was of course shown into
the private office. Since the manager was busily signing
papers, Cloud strolled to the side window and seemed to
gaze appreciatively at the masses of gorgeous blooms just
outside. What he really saw, however, was the detector
upon his wrist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nobody knew that he had in his sleeve a couple of
small, but highly efficient, tools. Nobody knew that he was
left-handed. Nobody saw what he did, nor was any signal
given that he did anything at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night, however, that window opened alarmlessly to
his deft touch. He climbed in, noiselessly. He might be
walking straight into trouble, but he had to take that
chance. One thing was in his favor; no matter how
crooked they were, they couldn’t keep armored troops on
duty as night-watchmen, and the Patrolmen could get
there as fast as their thugs could.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had brought no weapons. If he was wrong, he would
not need any and being armed would only aggravate his
offense. If right, there would be plenty of weapons available.
There were. A whole drawer full of DeLameters—fully
charged—belts and everything. He leaped across the
room to Graves’ desk; turned on a spy-ray. The sub-basement—“private
laboratories,” Graves had said—was
blocked. He threw switch after switch—no soap. Communicators—ah,
he was getting somewhere now—a steel-lined
room, a girl and a boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eureka! Good evening, folks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eureka? I hope you rot in hell, Graves.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This isn’t Graves. Cloud. Storm Cloud, the Vortex
Blaster, investigating.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Bob, the Patrol!” the girl screamed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quiet! This is a zwilnik outfit, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll say it is!” Ryder gasped in relief. “Thionite.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thionite! How could it be? How could they bring it in
here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They don’t. They’re growing broadleaf and <span class='it'>making</span> the
stuff. That’s why they’re going to kill us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just a minute.” Cloud threw in another switch. “Lieutenant?
Worse than I thought. <span class='it'>Thionite!</span> Get over here
fast with everything you got. Armor and semi-portables.
Blast down the Mayner Street door. Stairway to right, two
floors down, corridor to left, half-way along left side.
Room B-Twelve. Snap it up, but keep your eyes peeled!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But wait, Cloud!” the lieutenant protested. “Wait ’til
we get there—you can’t do anything alone!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t wait—got to get these kids out—evidence!”
Cloud broke the circuit and, as rapidly as he could,
one-handed, buckled on gun-belts. Graves would <span class='it'>have</span> to
kill these two youngsters, if he possibly could.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For God’s sake save Jackie, anyway!” Ryder prayed.
He knew just how high the stakes were. “And watch out
for gas, radiation, and traps—you must have sprung a
dozen alarms already.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What kind of traps?” Cloud demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beams, deadfalls, sliding doors—I don’t know what they
haven’t got. Graves said he could kill us in here with rays
or gas or.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take Graves’ private elevator, Dr. Cloud,” the girl
broke in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is it—which one?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s in the blank wall—the yellow button on his desk
opens it. Down as far as it will go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cloud jumped up listening with half an ear to the
babblings from below as he searched for air-helmets. Radiations,
in that metal-lined room, were out—except possibly
for a few beam-projectors, which he could deal with
easily enough. Gas, though, would be bad; but every
drug-house had air-helmets. Ah! Here they were!</p>

<p class='pindent'>He put one on, made shift to hang two more around his
neck—he had to keep his one hand free. He punched the
yellow button; rode the elevator down until it stopped of
itself. He ran along the corridor and drove the narrowest,
hottest possible beam of a DeLameter into the lock of
B-12. It took time to cut even that small semi-circle in that
refractory and conductive alloy—altogether too much time—but
the kids would know who it was. Zwilniks would
open the cell with a key, not a torch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They knew. When Cloud kicked the door open they fell
upon him eagerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A helmet and a DeLameter apiece. Get them on
quick! Now help me buckle this. Thanks. Jackie, you stay
back there, out of the way of our feet. Bob, you lie down
here in the doorway. Keep your gun outside and stick
your head out just far enough so you can see. No farther.
I’ll join you after I see what they’ve got in the line of
radiation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A spot of light appeared in a semi-concealed port, then
another. Cloud’s weapon flamed briefly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Projectors like those aren’t much good when the
prisoners have DeLameters,” he commented, “but I imagine
our air right now is pretty foul. It won’t be long now.
Do you hear anything?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Somebody’s coming, but suppose it’s the Patrol?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If so, a few blasts won’t hurt ’em—they’ll be in G P
armor.” Cloud did not add that Graves would probably
rush his nearest thugs in just as they were; to kill the two
witnesses before help could arrive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first detachment to round the corner was in fact
unarmored. Cloud’s weapon flamed white, followed quickly
by Ryder’s, and those zwilniks died. Against the next
to arrive, however, the DeLameters raved in vain. But only
for a second.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Back!” Cloud ordered, and swung the heavy door shut
as the attackers’ beams swept past. It could not be locked,
but it could be, and was, welded to the jamb with
dispatch, if not with neatness. “We’ll cut that trap-door
off, and stick it onto the door, too—and any more loose
metal we can find.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope they come in time,” the girl’s low voice carried
a prayer. Was this brief flare of hope false? Would not
only she and her Bob, but also their would-be rescuer, die?
“Oh! That noise—s’pose it’s the Patrol?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not really a noise—the cell was sound-proof—it
was an occasional jarring of the whole immense structure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wouldn’t wonder. Heavy stuff—probably semi-portables.
You might grab that bucket, Bob, and throw
some of that water that’s trickling in. Every little bit
helps.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The heavy metal of the door was glowing bright-to-dull
red over half its area and that area was spreading rapidly.
The air of the room grew hot and hotter. Bursts of live
steam billowed out and, condensing, fogged the helmets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The glowing metal dulled, brightened, dulled. The
prisoners could only guess at the intensity of the battle
being waged. They could follow its progress only by the
ever-shifting temperature of the barrier which the zwilniks
were so suicidally determined to burn down. For hours, it
seemed, the conflict raged. The thuddings and jarrings
grew worse. The water, which had been a trickle, was now
a stream and scalding hot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then a blast of bitterly cold air roared from the ventilator,
clearing away the gas and steam, and the speaker
came to life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good work, Cloud and you other two,” it said, chattily.
“Glad to see you’re all on deck. Get into this corner
over here, so the Zwilniks won’t hit you when they hole
through. They won’t have time to locate you—we’ve got a
semi right at the corner now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The door grew hotter, flamed fiercely white. A narrow
pencil sizzled through, burning steel sparkling away in all
directions—but only for a second. It expired. Through the
hole there flared the reflection of a beam brilliant enough
to pale the noon-day sun. The portal cooled; heavy streams
of water hissed and steamed. Hot water began to spurt
into the cell. An atomic-hydrogen cutting torch sliced
away the upper two-thirds of the fused and battered door.
The grotesquely-armored lieutenant peered in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They tell me all three of you are QX. Check?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Check.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good. We’ll have to carry you out. Step up here where
we can get hold of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll walk and I’ll carry Jackie myself,” Ryder protested,
while two of the armored warriors were draping Cloud
tastefully around the helmet of a third.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d get boiled to the hips—this water is deep and
hot. Come on!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The slowly rising water was steaming; the walls and
ceiling of the corridor gave mute but eloquent testimony
of the appalling forces that had been unleashed. Tile,
concrete, plastic, metal—nothing was as it had been. Cavities
yawned. Plates and pilasters were warped, crumbled,
fused into hellish stalactites; bare girders hung awry. In
places complete collapse had necessitated the blasting out
of detours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Through the wreckage of what had been a magnificent
building the cavalcade made its way, but when the open
air was reached the three rescued ones were not released.
Instead, they were escorted by a full platoon of soldiery to
an armored car, which was in turn escorted to the Patrol
station.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid to take chances with you until we find out
who’s who and what’s what around here,” the young
commander explained. “The Lensmen will be here in the
morning, with half an army, so I think you’d better spend
the rest of the night here, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Protective custody, eh?” Cloud grinned. “I’ve never
been arrested in such a polite way before, but it’s QX with
me. You, too, I take it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Us, too, decidedly,” Ryder assented. “This is a very
nice jail-house, especially in comparison with where
we’ve.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll say so!” Jackie broke in, giggling almost hysterically.
“I never thought I’d be tickled to death at getting
arrested, but I am!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lensmen came, and companies of Patrolmen equipped
in various fashions, but it was several weeks before the
situation was completely clarified. Then Ellington—Councillor
Ellington, the Unattached Lensman in charge
of all Narcotics—called the three into the office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How about Graves and Fairchild?” Cloud demanded
before the councillor could speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Both dead,” Ellington said. “Graves was shot down
just as he took off, but he blasted Fairchild first, just as he
intimated he would. There wasn’t enough of Fairchild left
for positive identification, but it couldn’t very well have
been anyone else. Nobody left alive seems to know much
of anything of the real scope of the thing, so we can
release you three now. Thanks, from me as well as the
Patrol. There is some talk that you two youngsters have
been contemplating a honeymoon out Chickladoria way?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no, sir—that is.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” Both spoke at once. “That
was just talk, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I realize that the report may have been exaggerated,
or premature, or both. However, not as a reward, but
simply in appreciation, the Patrol would be very glad to
have you as its guests throughout such a trip—all expense—if
you like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They liked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you. Lieutenant, please take Miss Cochran and
Mr. Ryder to the disbursing office. Dr. Cloud, the Patrol
will take cognizance of what you have done. In the meantime,
however, I would like to say that in uncovering this
thing you have been of immense assistance to us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing much sir, I’m afraid. I shudder to think of
what’s coming. If zwilniks can grow Trenconian broadleaf
anywhere.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at all, not at all,” Ellington interrupted. “If such
an entirely unsuspected firm as Tellurian Pharmaceuticals,
with all their elaborate preparations and precautions,
could not do much more than start, it is highly improbable
that any other attempt will be a success. You have given
us a very potent weapon against zwilnik operations—not
only thionite, but heroin, ladolian, nitrolabe, and the rest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What weapon?” Cloud was puzzled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Statistical analysis and correlation of apparently unrelated
indices.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But they’ve been used for years!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not the way you used them, my friend. Thus, while we
cannot count upon any more such extraordinary help as
you gave us, we should not need any. Can I give you a lift
back to Tellus?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think so, thanks. My stuff is en route now. I’ll
have to blow out this vortex anyway. Not that I think
there’s anything unusual about it—those were undoubtedly
murders, not vortex casualties at all—but for the record.
Also, since I can’t do any more extinguishing until my arm
finishes itself up, I may as well stay here and keep on
practising.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Practising? Practising what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gun-slinging—the lightning draw. I intend to get at
least a lunch while the next pirate who pulls a DeLameter
on me is getting a square meal.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Councillor Ellington conferred with another Gray
Lensman; one who was not even vaguely humanoid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you take him apart?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Practically cell by cell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you think the chances are of finding and
developing another like him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With a quarter of a million Lensmen working on it
now, and the number doubling every day, and with a
hundred thousand million planets, with almost that many
different cultures, it is my considered opinion that it is
merely a matter of time.”</p>

<p class='noindent'>SINCE BECOMING the Vortex Blaster, Neal Cloud lived
alone. Whenever he decently could, he traveled alone and
worked alone. He was alone now, hurtling through a
barren region of space toward Rift Seventy One and the
vortex next upon his list. In the interests of solitude,
convenience, and efficiency he was now driving a scout-class
ship which had been converted to one-man and
automatic operation. In one hold was his vortex-blasting
flitter; in the others his duodec bombs and other supplies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During such periods of inaction as this, he was wont to
think flagellantly of Jo and the three kids; especially of Jo.
Now, however, and much to his surprise and chagrin, the
pictures which had been so vividly clear were beginning to
fade. Unless he concentrated consciously, his thoughts
strayed elsewhere: to the last meeting of the Society; to
the new speculations as to the why and how of supernovae;
to food; to bowling—maybe he’d better start that
again, to see if he couldn’t make his hook roll smoothly
into the one-two pocket instead of getting so many seven-ten
splits. Back to food—for the first time in the Vortex
Blaster’s career he was really hungry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Which buttons would he push for supper? Steak and
Venerian mushrooms would be mighty good. So would
fried ham and eggs, or high-pressured gameliope.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An alarm bell jangled, rupturing the silence; a warm-blooded
oxygen-breather’s distress call, pitifully weak, was
coming in. It would have to be weak, Cloud reflected, as
he tuned it in as sharply as he could; he was a good eighty
five parsecs—at least an hour at maximum blast—away
from the nearest charted traffic lane. It was getting stronger.
It hadn’t just started, then; he had just gotten into its
range. He acknowledged, swung his little ship’s needle
nose into the line and slammed on full drive. He had not
gone far on the new course, however, when a tiny but
brilliant flash of light showed on his plate and the distress-call
stopped. Whatever had occurred was history.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cloud had to investigate, of course. Both written and
unwritten laws are adamant that every such call must be
heeded by any warm-blooded oxygen-breather receiving
it, of whatever race or class or tonnage or upon whatever
mission bound. He broadcast call after call of his own. No
reply. He was probably the only being in space who had
been within range.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still driving at max, he went to the rack and pulled
down a chart. He had never been in on a space emergency
before, but he knew the routine. No use to investigate the
wreckage; the brilliance of the flare was evidence enough
that the vessel and everything near it had ceased to exist.
It was lifeboats he was after. They were supposed to stick
around to be rescued, but out here they wouldn’t. They’d
have to head for the nearest planet, to be sure of air. Air
was far more important than either food or water; and
lifeboats, by the very nature of things, could not carry
enough air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus he steered more toward the nearest T-T (Tellus-Type)
planet than toward the scene of disaster. He put his
communicators, both sending and receiving, on automatic,
then sat down at the detector panel. There might not be
anything on the visuals or the audio. There had been
many cases of boats, jammed with women and children,
being launched into space with no one aboard able to
operate even a communicator. If any lifeboats had gotten
away from the catastrophe, his detectors would find them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was one; one only. It was close to the planet,
almost into atmosphere. Cloud aimed a solid communicator
beam. Still no answer. Either the boat’s communicator
was smashed or nobody aboard could run it. He’d have to
follow them down to the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But what was that? Another boat on the plate? Not a
lifeboat—too big—but not big enough to be a ship. Coming
out from the planet, apparently .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to rescue? No—what
the hell? The lug was <span class='it'>beaming</span> the lifeboat!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s go, you sheet-iron lummox!” the Blaster yelled
aloud, kicking in his every remaining dyne of drive. Then,
very shortly, his plate came suddenly to life. To semi-life,
rather, for the video was blurred and blotchy; the audio
full of breaks and noise. The lifeboat’s pilot was a Chickladorian;
characteristically pink except for red-matted hair
and red-streamed face. He was in bad shape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whoever it is that’s been trying to raise me, snap it
up!” the pink man said in “Spaceal,” the lingua franca of
deep space. “I couldn’t answer until I faked up this jury
rig. The ape’s aboard and he means business. I’m going to
black out, I think, but I’ve undogged the locks. Take over,
pal!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The picture blurred, vanished. The voice stopped. Cloud
swore, viciously.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='pindent'>The planet Dhil and its enormous satellite Lune are
almost twin worlds, revolving around their common center
of gravity and traversing as one the second orbit of their
sun. In the third orbit revolves Nhal, a planet strikingly
similar to Dhil in every respect of gravity, atmosphere,
and climate. Thus Dhilians and Nhalians are, to intents
and purposes, identical.<a id='r1'/><a href='#f1' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[1]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>The two races had been at war with each other, most of
the time, for centuries; and practically all of that warfare
had been waged upon luckless Lune. Each race was well
advanced in science. Each had atomic power, offensive
beams, and defensive screens. Neither had any degree of
inertialessness. Neither had ever heard of Civilization or
of Boskonia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this particular time peace existed, but only on the
surface. Any discovery or development giving either side
an advantage would rekindle the conflagration without
hesitation or warning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such was the condition obtaining when Darjeeb of Nhal
blasted his little space-ship upward from Lune. He was
glowing with pride of accomplishment, suffused with self-esteem.
Not only had he touched off an inextinguishable
atomic flame exactly where it would do the most good,
but also, as a crowning achievement, he had captured
Luda of Dhil. Luda herself; the coldest, hardest, most
efficient Minister of War that Dhil had ever had!</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as they could extract certain data from Luda’s
mind, they could take Lune in short order. With Lune
solidly theirs, they could bomb Dhil into submission in two
years. The goal of many generations would have been
reached. He, Darjeeb of Nhal, would have wealth, fame,
and—best of all—power!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gazing gloatingly at his captive with every eye he could
bring to bear, Darjeeb strolled over to inspect again her
chains and manacles. Let her radiate! No mentality in
existence could break <span class='it'>his</span> blocks. Physically, however, she
had to be watched. The irons were strong; but so was
Luda. If she could break free he’d probably have to shoot
her, which would be a very bad thing indeed. She hadn’t
caved in yet, but she would. When he got her to Nhal,
where proper measures could be taken, she’d give up
every scrap of knowledge she had ever had!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The chains were holding, all eight of them, and Darjeeb
kept on gloating as he backed toward his control station.
To him Luda’s shape was normal enough, since his own
was the same, but in the sight of any Tellurian she would
have been more than a little queer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lower part of her body was somewhat like that of a
small elephant; one weighing perhaps four hundred
pounds. The skin, however, was clear and fine and delicately
tanned; there were no ears or tusks; the neck was
longer. The trunk was shorter, divided at the tip to form a
highly capable hand; and between the somewhat protuberant
eyes of this “feeding” head there thrust out a
boldly Roman, startlingly human nose. The brain in this
head was very small, being concerned only with matters of
food.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Above this not-too-unbelievable body, however, there
was nothing familiar to us of Tellus. Instead of a back
there were two pairs of mighty shoulders, from which
sprang four tremendous arms, each like the trunk except
longer and much stronger. Surmounting those massive
shoulders there was an armored, slightly retractile neck
which bore the heavily-armored “thinking” head. In this
head there were no mouths, no nostrils. The four equally-spaced
<span class='it'>pairs</span> of eyes were protected by heavy ridges and
plates; the entire head, except for its junction with the
neck, was solidly sheathed with bare, hard, thick, tough
bone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Darjeeb’s amazing head shone a clean-scrubbed white.
But Luda’s—the eternal feminine!—was really something
to look at. It had been sanded, buffed, and polished. It
had been inlaid with bars and strips and scrolls of variously-colored
metals; then decorated tastefully in red and
green and blue and black enamel; then, to cap the climax,
<span class='it'>lacquered</span>!</p>

<p class='pindent'>But that was old stuff to Darjeeb; all he cared about
was the tightness of the chains immobilizing Luda’s hands
and feet. Seeing that they were all tight, he returned his
attention to his visiplates; for he was not yet in the clear.
Enemies might be blasting off after him any minute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A light flashed upon his detector panel. Behind him
everything was clear. Nothing was coming from Dhil. Ah,
there it was, coming in from open space. But nothing
<span class='it'>could</span> move that fast! A space-ship of some kind .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Gods
of the Ancients, <span class='it'>how</span> it was coming!</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a matter of fact the lifeboat was coming in at less
than one light; the merest crawl, as space-speeds go. That
velocity, however, was so utterly beyond anything known
to his system that the usually phlematic Nhalian stood
spellbound for a fraction of a second. Then he drove a
hand toward a control. Too late—before the hand had
covered half the distance the incomprehensibly fast ship
struck his own without impact, jar, or shock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Both vessels should have been blasted to atoms; but
there the stranger was, poised motionless beside him.
Then, under the urge of a ridiculously tiny jet of flame,
she leaped away; covering miles in an instant. Then something
equally fantastic happened. She drifted heavily <span class='it'>backward,
against</span> the full force of her driving blasts!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Only one explanation was possible—inertialessness!
What a weapon! With that and Luda—even without
Luda—the solar system would be his. No longer was it a
question of Nhal conquering Dhil. He himself would become
the dictator, not only of Nhal and Dhil and Lune,
but also of all other worlds within reach. That vessel and
its secrets <span class='it'>must</span> be his!</p>

<p class='pindent'>He blasted, then, to match the inert velocity of the
smaller craft, and as his ship approached the other he
reached out both telepathically—he could neither speak
nor hear—and with a spy-ray to determine the most feasible
method of taking over this Godsend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bipeds! Peculiar little beasts—repulsive. Only two arms
and eyes—only one head. Weak, no weapons—good!
Couldn’t <span class='it'>any</span> of them communicate? Ah yes, there was
one—an unusually thin, reed-like creature, bundled up in
layer upon layer of fabric.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see that you are survivors of a catastrophe in outer
space,” Darjeeb began. He correlated instantly, if not
sympathetically, the smashed panel and the pilot’s bleeding
head. If the creature had had a head worthy of the name,
it could have wrecked a dozen such frailties with it, and
without taking hurt. “Tell your pilot to let me in, so that I
may guide you to safety. Hurry! Those will come at any
moment who will destroy us all without warning or
palaver.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am trying, sir, but I cannot get through to him
direct. It will take a few moments.” The strange telepathist
began to make motions with her peculiar arms,
hands, and fingers. Others of the outlanders brandished
various repulsive members and gesticulated with ridiculous
mouths. Finally:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He says he would rather not,” the interpreter reported.
“He asks you to go ahead. He will follow you down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Impossible. We cannot land upon this world or its
primary, Dhil,” Darjeeb argued, reasonably. “These people
are enemies—savages—I have just escaped from them. It
is death to attempt to land anywhere in this system except
on my own world Nhal—that bluish one over there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well, we’ll see you there. We’re just about out of
air, but we can travel that far.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But that wouldn’t do, either, of course. Argument took
too much time. He’d have to use force, and he’d better
call for help. He hurled mental orders to a henchman,
threw out his magnetic grapples, and turned on a broad,
low-powered beam.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Open up or die,” he ordered. “I do not want to blast
you open, but time presses and I will if I must.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pure heat is hard to take. The portal opened and Darjeeb,
after donning armor and checking his ray-guns, picked
Luda up and swung nonchalantly out into space. Luda
was tough—a little vacuum wouldn’t hurt her much. Inside
the lifeboat, he tossed his captive into a corner and
strode toward the pilot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to know right now what it is that makes this
ship to be without inertia!” Darjeeb radiated, harshly. He
had been probing vainly at the pink thing’s mind-block.
“Tell your pilot to tell me or I will squeeze it out of his
brain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the order was being translated he slipped an arm out
of his suit and clamped a huge hand around the pilot’s
head. But just as he made contact, before he put on any
pressure at all, the weakling fainted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Also, two of his senses registered disquieting tidings. He
received, as plainly as though it was intended for him, a
welcome which the swaddled-up biped was radiating in
delight to an unexpected visitor rushing into the compartment.
He saw that that visitor, while it was also a biped,
was not at all like the frightened and harmless creatures
already cluttering the room. It was armed and armored, in
complete readiness for strife even with Darjeeb of Nhal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bonehead swung his ready weapon—with his build
there was no need, ever to turn—and pressed a stud. A
searing lance of flame stabbed out. Passengers screamed
and fled into whatever places of security were available.</p>

<p class='noindent'>CLOUD’S SWEARING wasted no time; he could swear
and act simultaneously. He flashed his vessel up near the
lifeboat, went inert, and began to match its intrinsic velocity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He’d have to board, no other way. Even if he had
anything to blast it with, and he didn’t—his vessel wasn’t
armed—he couldn’t, without killing innocent people. What
did he have?</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had two suits of armor; a G-P regulation and his
vortex special, which was even stronger. He had his DeLameters.
He had four semi-portables and two needle-beams,
for excavating. He had thousands of duodec
bombs, not one of which could be detonated by anything
less violent than the furious heart of a loose atomic vortex.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What else? Well, there was his sampler. He grinned as
he looked at it. About the size of a carpenter’s hand-axe,
with a savage beak on one side and a wickedly-curved,
razor-sharp blade on the other. It had a double-grip handle,
three feet long. A deceptive little thing, truly, for it
was solid dureum. It weighed fifteen pounds, and its ultra-hard,
ultra-tough blade could shear through neocarballoy
as cleanly as a steel knife slices cheese. Considering what
terrific damage a Valerian could do with a space-axe, he
should be able to do quite a bit with this—it ought to
qualify at least as a space-hatchet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He put on his armor, set his DeLameters to maximum
intensity at minimum aperture, and hung the sampler on a
belt-hook. He eased off his blasts. There, the velocities
matched. A minute’s work with needle-beam, tractors, and
pressor sufficed to cut the two smaller ships apart and to
dispose of the Nhalian’s magnets and cables. Another
minute of careful manipulation and his scout was in place.
He swung out, locked the port behind him, and entered
the lifeboat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was met by a high-intensity beam. He had not
expected instantaneous, undeclared war, but he was ready
for it. Every screen he had was full out, his left hand held
poised at hip a screened DeLameter. His return blast was,
therefore, a reflection of Darjeeb’s bolt, and it did vastly
more damage. The hand in which Darjeeb held the projector
was the one that had been manhandling the pilot, and
it was not quite back inside the Nhalian’s screens. In the
fury of Cloud’s riposte, then, gun and hand disappeared,
as did also a square foot of panel behind them. But
Darjeeb had other hands and other guns and for seconds
blinding beams raved against unyielding screens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Neither screen went down. The Tellurian bolstered his
weapons. It wouldn’t take much of this stuff to kill the
passengers remaining in the saloon. He’d go in with his
sampler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He lugged it up and leaped straight at the flaming
projector, with all of his mass and strength going into the
swing of his “space-hatchet.” The monster did not dodge,
but merely threw up a hand to flick the toy aside with his
gun-barrel. Cloud grinned fleetingly as he realized what
the other must be thinking—that the man must be puny
indeed to be making such ado about wielding such a
trifle—for to anyone not familiar with dureum it is sheerly
unbelievable that so much mass and momentum can possibly
reside in a bulk so small.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus when fiercely-driven cutting edge met opposing
ray-gun it did not waver or deflect. It scarcely even
slowed. Through the metal of the gun that vicious blade
sliced resistlessly, shearing flesh as it sped. On down, urged
by everything Cloud’s straining muscles could deliver.
Through armor it slashed, through the bony plating covering
that tremendous double shoulder, deep into the flesh
and bone of the shoulder itself; being stopped only by the
impact of the hatchet’s haft against the armor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, planting one steel boot on the helmet’s dome, he
got a momentary stance with the other between barrel
body and flailing arm, bent his back, and heaved. The
deeply-embedded blade tore out through bone and flesh
and metal, and as it did so the two rear cabled arms
dropped useless. That mighty rear shoulder and its appurtenances
were out of action. The monster still had one
good hand, however, and he was still full of fight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That hand flashed out, to seize the weapon and to wield
it against its owner. It came fast, too, but the man,
strongly braced, yanked backward. Needle point and keen
edge tore through flesh and snicked off fingers. Cloud
swung his axe aloft and poised, making it limpidly clear
that the next blow would be straight down into the top of
the head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was enough. Darjeeb backed away, every eye
glaring, and Cloud stepped warily over to Luda. A couple
of strokes of his blade gave him a length of chain. Then,
working carefully to keep his foe threatened at every
instant, he worked the chain into a tight loop around the
monster’s front neck, pulled it unmercifully taut around a
stanchion, and welded it there with his DeLameter. He did
not trust the other monster unreservedly, either, bound as
she was. In fact, he did not trust her at all. In spite of
family rows, like sticks to like in emergencies and they’d
gang up on him if they could. Since she wasn’t wearing
armor, however, she didn’t stand a chance with a DeLameter,
so he could take time now to look around.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pilot, lying flat upon the floor, was beginning to
come to. Not quite flat, either, for a shapely Chickladorian
girl, wearing the forty one square inches of covering
which were <span class='it'>de rigueur</span> in her eyes, had his bandaged head
in her lap—or, rather, cushioned on one bare leg—and
was sobbing gibberish over him. That wouldn’t help. Cloud
started for the first-aid locker, but stopped; a white-wrapped
figure was already bending over the injured man
with a black bottle in her hand. He knew what it was.
Kedeselin. That was what he was after, himself; but he
wouldn’t have dared give a hippopotamus the terrific jolt
she was pouring into him. She must be a nurse, or maybe
a doctor; but Cloud shivered in sympathy, nevertheless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pilot stiffened convulsively, then relaxed. His eyes
rolled; he gasped and shuddered; but he came to life and
sat up groggily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What the hell goes on here?” Cloud demanded urgently,
in spaceal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” the pink man replied. “All the ape said,
as near as I could get it, was that I had to give him our
free drive.” He then spoke rapidly to the girl—his wife,
Cloud guessed; if she wasn’t, she ought to be—who was
still holding him fervently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pink girl nodded. Then, catching Cloud’s eye, she
pointed at the two monstrosities, then at the nurse standing
calmly near by. Startlingly slim, swathed to the eyes in
billows of glamorette, she looked as fragile as a wisp of
straw; but Cloud knew Manarkans. She, too, nodded at
the Tellurian, then “talked” rapidly with her hands to a
short, thick-set, tremendously muscled woman of some
race entirely strange to the Blaster. She was used to going
naked; that was very evident. She had been wearing a
light “robe of convention,” but it had been pretty well
demolished in the melee and she did not realize that what
was left of it was hanging in tatters down her broad back.
The “squatty” eyed the gesticulating Manarkan and spoke,
in a beautifully modulated deep bass voice, to a supple,
lithe, pantherish girl with vertically-slitted yellow eyes,
pointed ears, and a long and sinuous, meticulously-groomed
tail. The Vegian—by no means the first of her
race Cloud had seen—spoke to the Chickladorian eyeful,
who in turn passed the message along to her husband.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The bonehead you had the argument with says to hell
with you,” the pilot translated to Cloud in spaceal. “He
says his mob will be out here after him directly, and if you
don’t cut him loose and give him the dope he wants they’ll
burn us all to cinders.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Luda was, meanwhile, trying to attract attention. She
was bouncing up and down, rattling her chains, rolling her
eyes, and in general demanding notice. More communication
ensued, culminating in:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The one with fancy-worked skull—she’s a frail, but not
the other bonehead’s frail, I guess—says pay no attention
to the ape. He’s a murderer, a pirate, a bum, a louse, and
so forth, she says. Says to take your axe—it’s <span class='it'>some</span>
cleaver, she says, and I check her to ten decimals on
that—cut his goddam head clean off, chuck his stinking
carcass out the port, and get the hell out of here as fast as
you can blast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That sounded to Cloud like good advice, but he didn’t
want to take such drastic action without more comprehensive
data.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But this was too much for the communications relays to
handle. Cloud did not know spaceal any too well, since he
had not been out in deep space very long. Also, spaceal is
a very simple language, not well adapted to the accurate
expression of subtle nuances of thought; and all those
intermediate translations were garbling things up terrifically.
Hence Cloud was not surprised that nothing much was
coming through, even though the prettied-up monster was,
by this time, just about throwing a fit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s quit trying to spin her yarn,” the pilot said
finally. “She says she’s been trying to talk to you direct, but
she can’t get through. Says to unseal your ports—cut your
screens—let down your guard—something like that, anyway.
Don’t know what she does mean, exactly. None of us
does except maybe the Manarkan, and if she does she
can’t get it across on her fingers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps my thought-screen?” Cloud cut it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“More yet,” the Chickladorian went on, shortly. “She
says there’s another one, just as bad or worse. On your
head, she says.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. No, on your head-bone—what the hell!
Skull? No, <span class='it'>inside</span> your skull, she says now.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Hell’s bells!
I don’t know what she <span class='it'>is</span> trying to say!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe I do—keep still a minute, all of you.” A
telepath undoubtedly, like the Manarkans—that was why
she had to talk to her first. He’d never been around
telepaths much—never tried it. He walked a few steps and
stared directly into one pair of Luda’s eyes—large, expressive
eyes, now soft and gentle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s it, chief! Now blast away .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. baffle your jets
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. relax, I guess she means. Open your locks and let her
in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cloud did relax, but gingerly. He didn’t like this mind-to-mind
stuff at all, particularly when the other mind
belonged to such a monster. He lowered his mental barriers
skittishly, ready to revolt at any instant; but as soon as
he began to understand the meaning of her thoughts he
forgot completely that he was not talking man to man.
And at that moment—such was the power of Luda’s mind
and the precision of her telepathy—every nuance of
thought became sharp and clear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I demand Darjeeb’s life!” Luda stormed. “Not because
he is the enemy of all my race—that would not weigh
with you—but because he has done what no one else,
however base, has ever been so lost to shame as to do. In
our city upon Lune he kindled an atomic flame which is
killing us in multitudes. In case you do not know, such
flames can never be extinguished.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know. We call them loose atomic vortices; but they
can be extinguished. In fact, putting them out is my
business.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh—incredible but glorious news.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” Luda’s thought
seethed, became incomprehensible for a space. Then:
“To win your help for my race I perceive that I must be
completely frank. Observe my mind closely, please—see
for yourself that I withhold nothing. Darjeeb wants at any
cost the secret of your vessel’s speed. With it, his race
would destroy mine utterly. I want it too, of course—with
it we would wipe out the Nhalians. However, since you
are so much stronger than would be believed possible—since
you defeated Darjeeb in single combat—I realize my
helplessness. I tell you, therefore, that both Darjeeb and I
have long since summoned help. Warships of both sides
are approaching, to capture one or both of these vessels.
The Nhalians are the nearer, and these secrets <span class='it'>must not</span>,
under any conditions, go to Nhal. Dash out into space
with both of these ships, so that we can plan at leisure.
First, however, kill that unspeakable murderer—you have
scarcely injured him the way it is—or give me that so-deceptive
little axe and I’ll be only too glad to do it
myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A chain snapped ringingly; metal clanged against metal.
Only two of Darjeeb’s major arms had been incapacitated;
his two others had lost only a few fingers apiece from
their hands. His immense bodily strength was almost
unimpaired. He could have broken free at any time, but
he had waited; hoping to take Cloud by surprise or that
some opportunity would arise for him to regain control of
the lifeboat. But now, feeling sure that Luda’s emminently
sensible advice would be taken, he decided to let inertialessness
go, for the moment, in the interest of saving his
life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kill him!” Luda shrieked the thought and Cloud swung
his weapon aloft, but Darjeeb was not attacking. Instead,
he was rushing into the airlock—escaping!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go free, pilot!” Cloud commanded, and leaped; but
the inner valve swung shut before he could reach it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as he could operate the lock Cloud went
through it. He knew that Darjeeb could not have boarded
the scout, since her ports were locked. He hurried to his
control room and scanned space. There the Nhalian was,
falling like a plummet. There also were a dozen or so
space-ships, too close for comfort, blasting upward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cloud cut in his Bergenholm, kicked on his driving blasts,
cut off, and went back into the lifeboat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Safe enough now,” he thought. “They’ll never get out
here inert. I’m surprised he jumped—didn’t figure him as a
suicidal type.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He isn’t. He didn’t,” Luda thought, dryly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Huh? He must have. That was a mighty long flit he
took off on, and his suit wouldn’t hold air.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He would stuff something into the holes. If necessary
he could have made it without air—or armor, either. He’s
tough. He still lives, curse him! But it is of no use for me
to bewail that fact now. Let us make plans. You must put
out the flame, and the leaders of our people will convince
you.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just a second—some other things come first.” He fell
silent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>First of all, he had to report to the Patrol, so they
could get some Lensmen and a task force out here to
straighten up this mess. With ordinary communicators,
that would take some doing—but wait, he had a double-ended
tight beam to the laboratory. He could get through
on that, probably, even from here. He’d have to mark the
lifeboat as a derelict and get these people aboard his
cruiser. No space-tube. The women could wear suits, but
this Luda.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t worry about me!” that entity cut in. “You saw
how I came aboard. I don’t <span class='it'>enjoy</span> breathing vacuum, but
I’m as tough as Darjeeb is. So <span class='it'>hurry</span>! During every moment
you delay, more of my people are dying!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“QX. While we’re transferring, give me the dope.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Luda did so. Darjeeb’s coup had been carefully planned
and brilliantly executed. Drugged by one of her own staff,
she had been taken without a struggle. She did not know
how far-reaching the stroke had been, but she was pretty
sure that most, if not all, of the Dhilian fortresses were
now held by the enemy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nhal probably had the advantage in numbers and in
firepower then upon Lune—Darjeeb would not have made
his bid unless he had found a way to violate the treaty of
strict equality. Dhil was, however, much the nearer of the
two worlds. Hence, if this initial advantage could be
overcome, Dhil’s reenforcements could be brought up
much sooner than the enemy’s. If, in addition, the vortex
could be extinguished before it had done irreparable damage,
neither side would have any real advantage and the
conflict would subside instead of flaring into another tri-world
holocaust.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cloud pondered. He would have to do something, but
what? That vortex had to be snuffed; but, with the whole
Nhalian army to cope with, how could he make the
approach? His vortex-bombing flitter was screened against
radiation, not war-beams. His cruiser was clothed to stop
anything short of G-P primaries, but it would take a
month at a Patrol base to adapt her for vortex work .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
and he’d have to analyze it, anyway, preferably from the
ground. He had no beams, no ordinary bombs, no nega-bombs.
How could he use what he had to clear a station?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Draw me a map, will you, Luda?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did so. The cratered vortex, where an immense
building had been. The ring of fortresses: two of which
were unusually far apart, separated by a parkway and a
shallow lagoon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shallow? How deep?” Cloud interrupted. She indicated
a depth of a couple of feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s enough map, then. Thanks.” Cloud thought for
minutes. “You seem to be quite an engineer. Can you give
me exact details on your defensive screen? Power, radius,
weave-form, generator type, phasing, interlocking, blow-off,
and so on?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She could. Complex mathematical equations and electrical
formulae flashed through his mind, each leaving a
residue of fact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe we can do something,” the Blaster said finally,
turning to the Chickladorian. “Depends pretty much on
our friend here. Are you a pilot, or just an emergency
assignment?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Master pilot, Rating unlimited, tonnage or space.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good! Think you’re in shape to take three thousand
centimeters of acceleration?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pretty sure of it. If I was right I could take three
thousand standing on my head. I’m feeling better all the
time. Let’s hot ’er up and find out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not until after we’ve unloaded these passengers somewhere,”
and Cloud went on to explain what he had in
mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Afraid it can’t be done.” The pilot shook his head
glumly. “Your timing has got to be too ungodly fine. I can
do the piloting, meter the blast, and so on. I can balance
her down on her tail, steady to a hair, but piloting’s only
half what you got to have. Pilots never land on a constant
blast, and your leeway here is damn near zero. To hit it as
close as you want, your timing has got to be accurate to a
tenth of a second. You don’t know it, mister, but it’d take
a master computer half a day to.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know all about that. I’m a master computer and I’ll
have everything figured. I’ll give you a zero exact to
plus-or-minus a hundredth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“QX, then. Let’s dump the non-combatants and flit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Luda, where shall we land them? And maybe you’d
better call out your army and navy—we can’t blow out
that vortex until we control both air and ground.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Land them there.” Luda swung the plate and pointed.
“The call was sent long since. They come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They landed; but four of the women would not leave
the vessel. The Manarkan <span class='it'>had</span> to stay aboard, she declared,
or be disgraced for life. What would happen if the
pilot passed out again, with only laymen around? She was
right, Cloud conceded, and she could take it. She was a
Manarkan, built of whalebone and rubber. She’d bend
under 3 + G’s, but she wouldn’t break.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The squatty insisted upon staying. Since when had a
woman of Tominga hidden from danger or run away from
a fight? She could hold the pilot’s head up through an
acceleration that would put any damn-fragile Tellurian
into a pack—or give her that funny axe and she’d show
him how it <span class='it'>ought</span> to be swung!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Chickladorian girl, too, stayed on. Her eyes—not
pink, but a deep, cool green, brimming with unshed tears—flashed
at the idea of leaving her man to die alone. She
just knew they were all going to die. Even if she couldn’t
be of any use, what of it? If her Thlaskin died she was
going to die too, right then, and that was all there was to
it. If they made her go ashore she’d cut her own throat
that very minute, so there! So that was that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So did the Vegian. Tail-tip twitching slightly, eyes sparkling,
she swore by three deities to claw the eyes out of,
and then to strangle with her tail, anyone who tried to put
her off ship. She had come on this trip to <span class='it'>see</span> things, and
did Cloud think she was going to miss seeing <span class='it'>this</span>? Hardly!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cloud studied her briefly. The short, thick, incredibly
soft fur—like the fur on the upper lip of a week-old
kitten, except more so—did not conceal the determined
set of her lovely jaw; the tight shorts and the even tighter,
purely conventional breastband did not conceal the tigerish
strength and agility of her lovely body. It’d be better,
the Blaster decided, not to argue the point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A dozen armed Dhilians came aboard, as pre-arranged,
and the cruiser blasted off. Then, while Thlaskin was
maneuvering inert, to familiarize himself with the controls
and to calibrate the blast, Cloud brought out the four
semi-portable projectors. They were frightful weapons,
designed for tripod mounting; so heavy that it took a very
strong man to lift one on Earth. They carried no batteries
or accumulators, but were powered by tight beams from
the mother ship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Luda was right; such weapons were unknown in that
solar system. They had no beam transmission of power.
The Dhilians radiated glee as they studied the things. They
had stronger stuff, but it was fixed-mount and far too
heavy to move. This was wonderful—these were magnificent
weapons indeed!</p>

<p class='pindent'>High above the stratosphere, inert, the pilot found his
spot and flipped the cruiser around, cross-hairs centering
the objective. Then, using his forward, braking jets as
drivers, he blasted her straight downward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She struck atmosphere almost with a thud. Only her
fiercely-driven meteorite-screens and wall-shields held her
together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope to Klono you know what you’re doing, chum,”
the Chickladorian remarked conversationally as the fortress
below leaped upward with appalling speed. “I’ve made
hot landings before, but I always had a hair or two of
leeway. If you don’t hit this to a couple of hundredths
we’ll splash when we strike. We won’t bounce, brother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can compute it to a thousandth and I can set the
clicker to within five, but it’s <span class='it'>you</span> that’ll have to do the
real hitting.” Cloud grinned back at the iron-nerved pilot.
“Sure a four-second call is enough to get your rhythm,
allow for reaction time and lag, and blast right on the
click?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Absolutely. If I can’t get it in four I can’t get it at all.
Got your stuff ready?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Uh-huh.” Cloud, staring into the radarscope, began to
sway his shoulders. He knew the exact point in space and
the exact instant of time at which the calculated deceleration
must begin; by the aid of his millisecond timer—two
full revolutions of the dial every second—he was about to
set the clicker to announce that instant. His hand swayed
back and forth—a finger snapped down—the sharp-toned
instrument began to give out its crisp, precisely-spaced
clicks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Got it!” Cloud snapped. “Right on the middle of the
click! Get ready, Thlaskin—seconds! Four! Three! Two!
One! Click!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Exactly with the click the vessel’s brakes cut off and her
terrific driving blasts smashed on. There was a cruelly
wrenching shock as everything aboard acquired suddenly a
more-than-three-times-Earthly weight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Luda and her fellows merely twitched. The Tomingan,
standing behind the pilot, supporting and steadying his
wounded head in its rest, settled almost imperceptibly, but
her firmly gentle hands did not yield a millimeter. The
Manarkan sank deeply into the cushioned bench upon
which she was lying; her quick, bright eyes remaining fixed
upon her patient.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Chickladorian girl, in her hammock, fainted quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Vegian, who had flashed one hand up to an overhead
bar at the pilot’s first move, stood up—although she
seemed to shorten a good two inches and her tight upper
garment parted with a snap as back-&nbsp;and shoulder-muscles
swelled to take the strain. <span class='it'>That</span> wouldn’t worry her. Cloud
knew—what <span class='it'>was</span> she stewing about? Oh—her tail! It was
too heavy for its own strength, great as it was, to lift! Her
left hand came down, around, and back; with its help the tail
came up. To the bar above her head, around it, tip
pointing stiffly straight upward. Then, smiling gleefully at
both Thlaskin and the Blaster, she shouted something that
neither could understand, but which was the war-cry of
her race:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tails high, brothers!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Downward the big ship hurtled, toward the now glowing
screens of the fortress. Driving jets are not orthodox
weapons, but properly applied, they can be deadly ones
indeed: and these were being applied with micromatric
exactitude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Down! DOWN!! The threatened fortress and its neighbors
hurled their every beam; Nhalian ships dived frantically
at the invader and did their useless best to blast her
down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Down she drove, the fortress’ screens flaming ever
brighter under the terrific blast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Closer! Hotter! Still closer! Hotter still! Nor did the
furious flame waver—the Chickladorian was indeed a
master pilot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Set up a plus ten, Thlaskin,” Cloud directed. “Air
density and temperature are changing. Their beams, too,
you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Check. Plus ten, sir—set up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give it to her on the fourth click from .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On, sir.” The vessel seemed to pause momentarily, to
stumble; but the added weight was almost imperceptible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A bare hundred yards now, and the ship of space was
still plunging downward at terrific speed. The screens were
furiously incandescent, but were still holding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A hundred feet, velocity appallingly high, the enemy’s
screens still up. Something <span class='it'>had</span> to give now! If that screen
stood up the ship would vanish as she struck it, but
Thlaskin the Chickladorian made no move and spoke no
word. If the skipper was willing to bet his own life on his
computations, who was he to squawk? But .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he must
have miscalculated!</p>

<p class='pindent'>No! While the vessel’s driving projectors were still a few
yards away the defending screens exploded into blackness;
the awful streams of energy raved directly into the structures
beneath. Metal and stone glared white, then flowed—sluggishly
at first, but ever faster and more mobile—then
boiled coruscantly into vapor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cruiser slowed—stopped—seemed to hang for an
instant poised. Then she darted upward, her dreadful
exhausts continuing and completing the utter devastation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s computin’, mister,” the pilot breathed as he cut
the fierce acceleration to a heavenly one thousand. “To
figure a dive like that to three decimals and have the guts
to hold to it cold—skipper, that’s com-pu-<span class='it'>tation</span>!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All yours, pilot,” Cloud demurred. “All I did was give
you the dope. You’re the guy that made it good. Hurt,
anybody?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nobody was. “QX. We’ll repeat, then, on the other side
of the lagoon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the ship began to descend on the new course the
vengeful Dhilian fleet arrived. Looping, diving, beaming,
oftentimes crashing in suicidal collision, the two factions
went maniacally to war. There were no attacks, however,
against the plunging Tellurian ship. The Nhalians had
learned that they could do nothing about that vessel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second fortress fell exactly as the first had fallen.
The pilot landed the cruiser in the middle of the shallow
lakelet. Cloud saw that the Dhilians, overwhelmingly superior
in numbers now, had cleared the air of Nhalian craft.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you fellows and your ships keep them off of my
flitter while I take my readings?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can,” the natives radiated happily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Four of the armored boneheads were <span class='it'>wearing</span> the semi-portable.
They had them perched lightly atop their feeding
heads, held immovably in place by two arms apiece.
One hand sufficed to operate the controls, leaving two
hands free to do whatever else might prove in order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us out!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lock opened, the Dhilian warriors sprang out and
splashed away to meet the enemy, who were already dashing
into the lagoon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cloud watched pure carnage. He hoped—yes, there
they were! The loyalists, seeing that their cause was not
lost, after all, had armed themselves and were smashing
into the fray.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Blaster broke out his flitter then, set it down near
the vortex, and made his observations. Everything was
normal. He selected three bombs from his vast stock,
loaded them into the tubes, and lofted. He set his screens,
adjusted his goggles, and waited; while far above him and
wide around him his guardian Dhilian war-vessels toured
watchfully, their drumming blasts a reassuring thunder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He waited, eyeing the sigma curve as it flowed backward
from the recording pen, until he got a ten-second
prediction. He shot the flitter forward, solving instantaneously
the problems of velocity and trajectory. At exactly
the correct instant he released a bomb. He cut his drive
and went free.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bomb sped truly, striking the vortex dead center. It
penetrated deeply enough. The carefully-weighed charge
of duodec exploded; its energy and that of the vortex
combining in a detonation whose like no inhabitant of that
solar system had ever even dimly imagined.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The noxious gases and the pall of smoke and pulverized
debris blew aside; the frightful waves of lava quieted
down. The vortex was out and would remain out. The
Blaster drove back to the cruiser and put his flitter away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh—you did it! Thanks! I didn’t believe that you—that
anybody—really could!” Luda was almost hysterical
in her joyous relief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing to it,” Cloud deprecated. “How are you doing
on the mopping up?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Practically clean,” Luda answered, grimly. “We now
know who is who. Those who fought against us or who did
not fight for us are, or very soon will be, dead. But the
Nhalian fleet comes. Does yours? Ours takes off in moments.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait a minute!” Cloud sat down at his plate, made
observations and measurements, calculated mentally. He
turned on his communicator and conferred briefly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Nhalian fleet will be here in seven hours and
eighteen minutes. If your people go out to meet them it
will mean a war that not even the Patrol can stop without
destroying most of the ships and men both of you have in
space. The Patrol task force will arrive in seven hours and
thirty one minutes. Therefore, I suggest that you hold
your fleet here, in formation but quiescent, under instructions
not to move until you order them to, while you and I
go out and see if we can’t stop the Nhalians.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Stop</span> them!” Luda’s thought was not at all ladylike.
“What with, pray?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” Cloud confessed, “but it wouldn’t do
any harm to try, would it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Probably not. We’ll try.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All the way out Cloud pondered ways and means. As
they neared the onrushing fleet he thought at Luda:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Darjeeb is undoubtedly with that fleet. He knows that
this is the only inertialess ship in this part of space. He
wants it more than anything else in the universe. Now if
we could only make him listen to reason .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. if we could
make him see.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He broke off. No soap. You couldn’t explain “green” to
a man born blind. These folks didn’t know and wouldn’t
believe what real firepower was. The weakest vessel in
this oncoming task force could blast both of these boneheads’
fleets into a radiant gas in fifteen seconds flat—and
the superdreadnoughts’ primaries would be starkly incredible
to both Luda and Darjeeb. They simply <span class='it'>had</span> to be seen
in action to be believed; and then it would be too late.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These people didn’t stand the chance of a bug under a
sledgehammer, but they’d have to be killed before they’d
believe it. A damned shame, too. The joy, the satisfaction,
the real advancement possible only through cooperation
with each other and with the millions of races of Galactic
Civilization—if there were only some means of <span class='it'>making</span>
them believe.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We—and they—<span class='it'>do</span> believe.” Luda broke into his somber
musings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Huh? What? You do? You were listening?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly. At your first thought I put myself en rapport
with Darjeeb, and he and our peoples listened to your
thoughts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you really believe me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We all believe. Some will cooperate, however, only as
far as it will serve their own ends to do so. Your Lensmen
will undoubtedly have to kill that insect Darjeeb and
others of his kind in the interest of lasting peace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The insulted Nhalian drove in a protesting thought, but
Luda ignored it and went on:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You think, then, Tellurian, that your Lensmen can
cope with even such as Darjeeb of Nhal?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll say they can!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is well, then. Come aboard, Darjeeb—unarmed and
unarmored, as I am—and we will together go to confer
with these visiting Lensmen of Galactic Civilization. It is
understood that there will be no warfare until our return.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Holy Klono!” Cloud gasped. “He wouldn’t do <span class='it'>that</span>,
would he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly.” Luda was surprised at the question. “Although
he is an insect, and morally and ethically beneath
contempt, he is, after all, a reasoning being.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“QX.” Cloud was dumbfounded, but tried manfully not
to show it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Darjeeb came aboard. He was heavily bandaged and
most of his hands were useless, but he seemed to bear no
ill-will. Cloud gave orders; the ship flashed away to meet
the Patrolmen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The conference was held. The boneheads, after being
taken through a superdreadnought and through a library
by Lensmen as telepathic as themselves, capitulated to
Civilization immediately and whole-heartedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You won’t need me any more, will you, admiral?”
Cloud asked then.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think so—no. Nice job, Cloud.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks. I’ll be on my way, then; the people I picked
up must be off my ship by this time. Clear ether.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='70' id='Page_70'></span><h1 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>Chapter 7</span><br/> ▂▂▂▂▂▂<span style='font-size:larger'>THE BLASTER ACQUIRES A CREW</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'>CLOUD, RETURNING to his cruiser, found that most of
his shipwrecked passengers had departed. Five of them,
however—the two Chickladorians, the Manarkan, the
squatty, and the Vegian—were still on board. Thlaskin,
now back to normal, came to attention and saluted crisply;
the women bowed or nodded and looked at him with
varying degrees of interrogation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How come, Thlaskin? I thought all the passengers were
going back with the task force.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are, boss. They’ve gone. We followed your orders,
boss—chivied ’em off. I checked with the flagship
about more crew besides us, and he says QX. Just tell me
how many you want of what, and I’ll get ’em.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want anybody!” Cloud snapped. “Not even
you. Not <span class='it'>any</span> of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jet back, boss!” Spaceal was a simple language, and
inherently slangy and profane, but there was no doubt as
to the intensity of the pilot’s feelings. “I don’t know why
you were running this heap alone, or how long, but I got a
couple questions to ask. Do you know just how many
million ways these goddam automatics can go haywire in?
Do you know what to do about half of ’em when they do?
Or are you just simply completely nuts?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. Not too much. I don’t think so.” As he answered
the three questions in order Cloud’s mind flashed back to
what Phil Strong and several other men had tried so
heatedly to impress upon him—the stupidity, the lunacy,
the sheer, stark idiocy of a man of <span class='it'>his</span> training trying to go
it solo in deep space. How did one say “You have a point
there, but before I make such a momentous decision we
should explore the various possibilities of what is a completely
unexpected development” in spaceal? One didn’t!
Instead:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe QX, maybe not. We’ll talk it over. Tell the
Manarkan to try to work me direct—maybe I can receive
her now, after working the boneheads.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She could. Communication was not, perhaps, as clear as
between two Manarkans or two Lensmen, but it was clear
enough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You wish to know why I have included myself in your
crew,” the white-swathed girl began, as soon as communication
was established. “It is the law. This vessel, the
<span class='it'>Vortex Blaster I</span>, of Earth registry, belonging to the Galactic
Patrol, is of a tonnage which obligates it to carry a
medical doctor; or, in and for the duration of an emergency
only, a registered graduate nurse. I am both R.N. and
M.D. If you prefer to employ some other nursing doctor
or doctor and nurse that is of course your right; but I can
not and will not leave this ship until I am replaced by
competent personnel. If I did such a thing I would be
disgraced for life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I haven’t got a payroll—I never have had one!”
Cloud protested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t quibble, please. It is also the law that any
master or acting master of any ship of this tonnage is
authorized to employ for his owner—in this case the
Galactic Patrol—whatever personnel is necessary, whenever
necessary, at his discretion. With or without pay,
however, I stay on until replaced.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I don’t <span class='it'>need</span> a doctor—or a nurse, either!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Personally, now, no,” she conceded, equably enough.
“I checked into that. As the chief of your great laboratory
quoted to you, ‘This too, shall pass.’ It is passing. But you
<span class='it'>must</span> have a crew; and any member of it, or you yourself,
may require medical or surgical attention at any time. The
only question, then, is whether or not you wish to replace
me. Would you like to examine my credentials?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. Having been en rapport with your mind, it is not
necessary. But are you, after your position aboard the ship
which was lost, interested in such a small job as this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would like it very much, I’m sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well. If any of them stay, you can—at the same
pay you were getting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Thlaskin, the Vegian. No, hold it! We’ve got to
have something better than spaceal, and a lot of Vegians
go in for languages in a big way. She may know English
or Spanish, since Vegia is one of Tellus’ next-door neighbors.
I’ll try her myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, to the girl, “Do you speak English, miss?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, eggzept in glimzzez only,” came the startling reply.
“Two Galactic Zdandard yearzz be pazz—come?
Go?—’ere I mazzter zhe, zo perverze mood and tenze.
Zhe izz zo difficult and abzdruze.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Switching to Galactic Spanish, which language was
threatening to become the common tongue of Galactic
Civilization, she went on:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I heard you say ‘Zbanidge.’ I know Galactic Spanish
very well. I speak it well, too, except for the sounds of
‘ezz’ and ‘zeta,’ which all we Vegians must make much too
hard—z-z-z-, zo. One hears that nearly all educated Tellurians
have the Spanish, and you are educated, of a
certainty. You speak it, no?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Practically as well as I do English,” Cloud made relieved
reply. “You have very little accent, and that little is
charming. My name is Neal Cloud. May I ask yours?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Neelcloud? I greet you. Mine is Vezzptkn .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but no,
you couldn’t pronounce it. ‘Vezzta,’ it would have to be in
your tongue.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“QX. We have a name very close to that—Vesta.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s exactly what I said—Vezz-ta.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh—excuse me, please. You were talking to this lady—Tomingan,
she said? What language were you using?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fourth-continent Tomingan, Middle Plateau dialect.
Hers. She was an engineer in a big power plant on
Manarka, is how she came to learn their sign language.
Tomingans don’t go in for linguistics much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you very evidently do. How many languages do
you know, young lady?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only fifty so far—plus their dialects, of course. I’m
only half-way to my Master of Languages degree. Fifty
more to learn yet, including your cursed <span class='it'>Englidge</span>. P-f-zt-k!”
Vesta wrinkled her nose, bared her teeth, and emitted a
noise very similar to that made by an alley cat upon
meeting a strange dog. “I don’t know whether spaceal will
count for credit or not, but I’m going to learn it anyway.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nice going, Vesta. Now, why did <span class='it'>you</span> appoint yourself
a member of this party?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wanted to go, and since I can’t pay fare.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You wouldn’t have had to!” Cloud interrupted. “If you
lost your money aboard that ship, the Patrol would take
you anywhere.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I didn’t mean <span class='it'>that</span>.” She dipped into her belt-bag
and held out for the man’s inspection a book of Travelers’
Cheques good for fifty thousand G-P credits! “I wanted to
continue with you, and I knew this wasn’t a passenger
ship. I can be useful—who do you think lined up that
translation relay?—and besides, I can work. I can cook—keep
house—and I can learn any other job fast. You
believe me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cloud looked at her. She was as tall as he was, and
heavier; stronger and faster. “Yes, you can work, if you
want to, and I think you would. But you haven’t said why
you want to go along.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mostly because it’s the best chance I’ll ever have to
learn English. I went to Tellus once before to learn
it—but there are too many Vegians there. Young Vegians,
like me, like to play too much. You know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve heard so. But teachers, courses.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I need neither teachers nor courses. What I need is
what you have in your library—solid English.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“QX. I’ll reserve judgment on you, too. Now let’s hear
what the Tomingan has to say. What’s <span class='it'>her</span> name?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d be surprised!” Vesta giggled in glee. “Literally
translated, it’s ‘Little flower of spring, dwelling bashfully
by the brook’s damply sweet brink.’ And that’s an <span class='it'>exact</span>
transliteration, so help me—believe it or not!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll take your word for it. What shall we call her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Um .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. m .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ‘Tommie’ would be as good as anything,
I guess.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“QX. Tommie of Tominga. Ask her why she thinks she
has to be a member of our crew.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who else do you have who can repair one of your big
atomic engines if it lets go?” came the answering question,
in Vesta’s flawlessly idiomatic Galactic Spanish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cloud was amazed at Tommie’s changed appearance.
She was powdered, perfumed, and painted: made up to
the gills. Her heavy blonde hair was elaborately waved. If
it wasn’t for her diesel-truck build, Cloud thought—and
for the long black Venerian cigar she was smoking with
such evident relish—she’d be a knockout on anybody’s
tri-di screen!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can.” The profoundly deep, but pleasantly and musically
resonant voice went on; the fluent translation continued.
“What I don’t know about atomic engines hasn’t been
found out yet. I don’t know much about Bergenholms and
a couple of other things pertaining solely to flight, and I
don’t know <span class='it'>anything</span> about communicators or detectors,
which aren’t engineers’ business. I’ve laid in a complete
supply of atomic service manuals for class S-C ships, and I
tell you this—if anything with a motor or an engine in it
aboard this vessel ever has run, I can take it apart and put
it back together so it’ll run again. And by the way, you
didn’t have half enough spare parts aboard, but you have
now. Besides, you might need somebody to really swing
that axe of yours, some day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cloud studied the Tomingan narrowly. She <span class='it'>wasn’t</span> bragging,
he decided finally. She was simply voicing what to
her were simple truths.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your arguments have weight. Why do you want the
job?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Several reasons. I’ve never done anything like this
before, and it’ll be fun. Main reason, though, is that I
think I’ll be able to talk you into doing a job on Tominga
that has needed doing for a long time. I was a passenger,
not an officer, on my way to talk to a party about ways of
getting it done. You changed my mind. You and I, with
some others who’ll be glad to help, will be able to do it
better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tommie volunteered no more information, and Cloud
asked no more questions. Explanation would probably
take more time than could be spared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now you, Thlaskin,” the Blaster said in spaceal. “What
have you got to say for yourself?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve got me on a hell of a spot, boss,” the pilot
admitted, ruefully. “You’ve <span class='it'>got</span> to have a pilot, no question
about that. You already know I’m one. I know
automatics, and communicators, and detectors—the
works. Ordinarily I’d say you’d <span class='it'>have</span> to have <span class='it'>me</span>. But this
ain’t a regular case. I wasn’t a pilot on the heap that got
knocked out of the ether, but a passenger. Maluleme—she’s
my .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. say, ain’t there no word for.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He broke off and spoke rapidly to his wife, who relayed
it to Vesta.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re newlyweds,” the Vegian translated. “He was
off duty and they were on their honeymoon.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vesta’s wonderfully expressive face softened, saddened.
She appeared about to cry. “I wish <span class='it'>I</span> were old enough to
be a newlywed,” she said, plaintively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Huh? Aren’t you?” the Blaster demanded. “You look
old enough to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’m as big as I ever will be, and I won’t change
outside. It’s inside. About half a year yet. But she’s
saying—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We know that pilots on duty, in regular service, can’t
have their wives aboard. But this isn’t a regular run, I
know, so couldn’t you—just this once—keep Thlaskin on
as pilot and let me come too? <span class='it'>Please</span>, Mr. Neelcloud—she
didn’t know your name, but asked me to put it in—I can
work my way. I’ll do any of the jobs nobody else wants to
do—I’ll do <span class='it'>anything</span>, Mr. Neelcloud!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pink girl jumped up and took Cloud’s left hand in
both her own. Simultaneously Vesta took his right hand in
her left, brought it up to her face, and laid the incredibly
downy softness of her cheek against the five-hour bristles
of his; sounding the while a soft, low-pitched but unmistakable
<span class='it'>purr</span>!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just this once wouldn’t do any harm, would it, Captain
Neelcloud?” Vesta purred. “You zmell <span class='it'>zo</span> wonderful, and
she zmells nice, too. <span class='it'>Pleeze</span> keep her on!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“QX. You win!” The Blaster pulled himself loose from
the two too-demonstrative females and addressed the
group at large. “I think I ought to have my head examined,
but I’m signing all of you on as crew. But <span class='it'>nobody
else</span>. I’ll get the book.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He got it. He signed them on. Chief Pilot Thlaskin.
Chief Engineer Tommie. Linguist Vesta. Doctor .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what?
He tried to call her attention by thinking at her, but
couldn’t. Then, through Vesta: Manarkans didn’t have
names, but were known by their personality patterns.
Didn’t they sign something to documents? No, they used
finger-prints only, without signatures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But we’ve got to have <span class='it'>something</span> we can put in the
book!” Cloud protested. “Tell her to pick one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No preference,” Vesta reported. “I’m to do it. I knew
a lovely Tellurian named “Nadinevandereckelberg” once.
Let’s call her that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nadine van der Eckelberg? Better not. Not common
enough—there might be repercussions. We can use part of
it, though. ‘Nadine,’ bracketed with her prints .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. there.
Now how about Maluleme?” He turned to the “Classification”
listing and frowned. “What to class <span class='it'>her</span> as I’ll never
know. She’s got just about as much business aboard this
bucket as I would have in a sultan’s harem.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You might find quite a lot—and <span class='it'>that</span> I’d like to see!”
Vesta snickered. “But look under ‘Mizzelaneouz,’ there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her stiff, sharp fingernail ran down the column almost
to the end. “ ‘Zupercargo’? We have no cargo. ‘Zupernumerary’?
That’s it! See? I read: ‘Zupernumerary—Perzonnel
beyond the nezezzary or uzhual; ezpedjially
thoze employed not for regular zervize, but only to fill the
plazez of otherz in caze of need.’ Perfect!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whose place could <span class='it'>she</span> fill?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The cook’s—if the automatics break down,” Vesta
explained, gleefully. “She says she can really cook—so
even if they didn’t break down she can tape lots of nice
things to eat that aren’t in your kitchen banks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Could be. I can get away with that. ‘Supernumerary
(cook 1/c) Maluleme’ and her prints .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. there. Now we’re
organized—let’s flit. Ready, Thlaskin?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ready, sir,” and the good ship <span class='it'>Vortex Blaster I</span> took
off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Vesta, I s’pose you’ve all picked out your cabins
and got located?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“QX. Tell ’em all, except Tommie, to go and do whatever
they think they ought to be doing. Tell Tommie to sit
down at the chart-table. We’ll join her. I want to find out
what she’s got on her mind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pulling a chart and rolling it out flat on the table, Cloud
went on: “We’re in this unexplored region, here, about
thirty two dash twenty five.<a id='r2'/><a href='#f2' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[2]</span></sup></a> We’re headed for Nixson II,
about sixty one dash forty six.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nixson? Why, that’s only three thousand parsecs—a
day and a half, say—from Tominga, where I want you to
go!” Tommie exclaimed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Check. That’s why I’m going to listen to what you
have to say. We can pick Manarka up—sixty five dash
thirty-five, here; they’ve got two really bad ones—on the
way back. It’s a long flit to Chickladoria—’way over
there, one seventy seven dash thirty four—but I’ve got to
go there pretty quick, anyway. It’s way up on the A list.
So, Tommie, start talking.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='pindent'>The run to Nixson II was uneventful, and Cloud rid
that planet of its loose atomic vortices in a few hours. The
cruiser then headed directly for Tominga, one man short,
for Tommie was not aboard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now remember, no matter what happens, you don’t
know any one of us,” had been the Blaster’s parting
instructions to her. “After we’ve checked in at the hotel
we’ll meet in the lobby. Be sure you’re sitting—or standing—some
place where Vesta can pass a couple of words
with you without anybody catching on. Check?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Check.”</p>

<p class='noindent'>IMMEDIATELY AFTER SUPPER Cloud called Vesta
and Nadine into his cabin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You first, Nadine.” He caught her eyes and stopped
talking, but went on thinking. He was amazed at how easy
it had been to learn the knack of telepathy with both
Luda and the Manarkan. “How did you make out with
Tommie? Can’t she read you at all?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at all. I can read her easily enough, but she can
neither send nor receive.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How about Vesta, then? Any more progress?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. Just like you. She learned very quickly to receive,
but that is all. She cannot tune her mind; I have to do it
all.” It also amazed the Blaster that, after learning one
half of telepathy so easily, he had been unable even to get
a start on the other half. “We might try it again, though,
all three of us together?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They tried, but it was no use. Think as they would, of
even the simplest things—squares, crosses, triangles, and
circles—staring eye to eye and even holding hands, neither
the Blaster nor the Vegian could touch the other’s mind.
Nor could the Manarkan tell them or show them what to
do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, that’s out, then.” Cloud frowned in concentration,
the fingers of his left hand drumming almost soundlessly
on the table’s plastic top. “Nadine, you can’t send
simultaneously to both Vesta and me, because we can’t
tune ourselves into resonance with you, as a real telepath
could. However, could you read me and send my thoughts
to Vesta, and do it fast enough to keep up? As fast as I
talk, say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, easily. I don’t have to tune sharply to receive—unless
there’s a lot of interference, of course—and even
then, Vesta can read my shorthand. She learned it before
we met you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hm .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. m. Interesting. Let’s try it out. I’ll think at
you, you put it down in shorthand. You, Vesta, tape it in
Spanish. Get your notebook and recorder .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ready? Let’s
go!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There ensued a strange spectacle. Cloud, leaning back
in his seat with his eyes closed, mumbled to himself in
English, to slow his thoughts down to approximately two
hundred words per minute. Nadine, paying no visible
attention to the man, wrote unhurried, smoothly-flowing—most
of the time—symbols. Vesta, throat-mike in place
and yellow-eyed gaze nailed to the pencil’s point, kept
pace effortlessly—most of the time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all. Play it back, Vesta. If you girls got half of
that, you’re <span class='it'>good</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The speaker came to life, giving voice to a completely
detailed and extremely technical report on the extinction
of an imaginary atomic vortex, and as the transcription
proceeded Cloud’s amazement deepened. It was evident,
of course, that neither of the two translators knew anything
at all about many of the scientific technicalities
involved. Nevertheless the Manarkan had put down—and
Vesta had recorded in good, idiomatic Galactic Spanish—an
intelligent layman’s idea of what it was that had been
left out. That impromptu, completely unrehearsed report
would have been fully informative to any expert of the
Vortex Control Laboratory!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Girls, you <span class='it'>are</span> good—<span class='it'>very</span> good.” Cloud paid deserved
tribute to ability. “First chance we get, I’ll split a bottle of
fayalin with you. Now we’d better hit the sack. We land
early in the morning, and since we’re going to stay here a
while we’ll have to go through quarantine and customs. So
pack your bags and have ’em ready for inspection.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They landed at the spaceport of Tommie’s home town,
which Cloud, after hearing Vesta’s literal translation of its
native name, had entered in his log as “Mingia.” They
passed their physicals and healths easily enough—the requirements
for leaving a planet of warm-blooded oxygen-breathers
are so severe and so comprehensive that the
matter of landing on a similar one is almost always a
matter of simple routine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Manarkan doctors we know of old; you are welcome
indeed. We see very few Tellurians or Vegians, but the
standards of those worlds are very high and we are glad to
welcome you. But Chickladoria? I never heard of it—we’ve
had no one from that planet since I took charge of
this port of entry.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tomingan official punched buttons, gabbled briefly,
and listened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes. Excellent! The health, sanitation, and exit
requirements of Chickladoria are approved by the Galactic
Medical Society. We welcome you. You all may pass.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They left the building and boarded a copter for their
hotel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and part of its name is ‘Forget-me-not’! Isn’t that a
dilly of a name for a hotel?” Vesta, who had been telepathing
busily with Nadine, was giggling sunnily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly, however, she stopped laughing and, eyes
slitted, leaped for the door. Too late: the craft was
already in the air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know what that .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that <span class='it'>clunker</span> back there
<span class='it'>really</span> thought of us?” she flared. “That we’re weak, skinny,
insipid, under-developed little <span class='it'>runts</span>! By Zevz and Tlazz
and Jadkptn, I’ll show him—I’ll take a tail-wrap around
his neck and.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pipe down, Vesta—listen!” Cloud broke in, sharply.
“You’re smart enough to know better than to explode that
way. For instance, you’re stronger than I am, and faster—admitted.
So what? I’m still your boss. And Tommie isn’t,
even though, as you ought to know by this time, she could
pull your tail out by the roots and beat you to death with
the butt end of it in thirty seconds flat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Huh?” Vesta’s towering rage subsided miraculously
into surprised curiosity. “But you’re <span class='it'>admitting</span> it!” she
marvelled. “Even that <span class='it'>I</span> am stronger and faster than <span class='it'>you</span>
are!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly. Why not? Servos are faster still, and ordinary
derricks are stronger. It’s <span class='it'>brains</span> that count. I’d much
rather have your linguistic ability than the speed and
strength of a Valerian.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So would I, really,” Vesta purred. “You’re the <span class='it'>nicest</span>
man!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So watch yourself, young lady,” Cloud went on evenly,
“and behave yourself. If you don’t, important as you are
to this project, I’ll send you back to the ship in irons.
That’s a promise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“P-f-z-t-k!” Vesta fairly spat the expletive. Her first
thought was sheer defiance, but under the Blaster’s level
stare she changed her mind visibly. “I’ll behave myself,
Captain Neelcloud.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks, Vesta. You’ll be worth a whole platoon of
Tomingans if you do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The copter landed on the flat roof of the hotel. The
guests were registered and shown to their rooms. The
Forget-Me-Not’s air was hot and humid, and the visitors
wore the only clothing to be seen. Nevertheless, Cloud was
too squeamish to go all the way, so he still wore shorts
and sandals, as well as the side-arm of his rank, when he
went back up to the lobby to meet his crew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vesta, tail-tip waving gracefully a foot and a half above
her head, was wearing only her sandals. Thlaskin wore
shorts and space-boots. Maluleme had reduced her conventional
forty one square inches of covering to a daring
twenty five—two narrow ribbons and a couple of jewels.
Nadine, alone of them all, had made no concession to that
stickily sweltering climate. She’d be disgraced for life,
Cloud supposed, if she cut down by even one the hundreds
of feet of white glamorette in which she was swathed. But
Manarkans didn’t sweat like Tellurians, he guessed—if
they did, she’d either peel or smother before this job was
over!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cloud scanned the lobby carefully. Were they attracting
too much attention? They were not. They had had to pose
for Telenews shots, of course—the Chickladorians in particular
had been held in the spots for all of five minutes—but
that was all. Like any other spaceport city, Mingia
was used to outlandish forms of warm-blooded, oxygen-breathing
life. Not counting his own group, he could see
members of four different non-Tomingan races, two of
which were completely strange to him. And Tommie,
standing alone in front of one of the row of shop-windows
comprising one wall of the lobby—and very close to a
mirrored pillar—was intently studying a tobacconist’s display
of domestic and imported cigars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“QX,” the Blaster said then. “We aren’t kicking up any
fuss. Do your stuff, Vesta.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl sauntered over to the mirror, licked her
forefinger, and began to smooth an imaginary roughness
out of one perfect eyebrow. Thus, palm covering mouth—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He still hangs out here, Tommie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He still eats supper here every night, in the same
private room.” Tommie did not move or turn her head;
her voice could not be heard three feet away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When he comes in, take one good look at him and
think ‘This is the one’—Nadine’ll take over from there.
Then sneak down to the chief’s suite and join us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vesta, with a final approving pat at her sleek head,
sauntered on; past a display of belt-pouches in which she
was not interested, pausing before one of ultra-fancy candies
in which she very definitely was, and back to her own
group.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the green,” she reported.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I’ll go on about my business of getting things
lined up to blow out vortices. You, Thlaskin and Maluleme,
just run around and play. Act innocent—you’re just
atmosphere for now. Nadine and Vesta, go down to my
suite—here’s a key—and get your recorder and stuff
ready. I’ll see you later.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cloud came back, however, rather sooner than he had
intended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t get far—I’ll have to take you along if I want
to get any business done,” he explained to Vesta. “Up to
now, I’ve got along very nicely with English, Spanish, and
spaceal, but not here. We’re a long ways from either
Tellus or Vegia.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are indeed. I don’t know what they do use for an
interstellar language here—I’ll have to find out and see if
I know it yet.” Vesta then switched to English. “While we
wait, do you mind if I zpeak at you in Englizh? And will
you ztop me and correct, please, the errors I will make?
My pronunziazion is getting better, but I ztill have much
trouble with your irregular verbs and pronouns. I come,
but I am not yet arrive.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll say you’re better!” Cloud knew that she had been
studying hard; studying with an intensity of concentration
comparable only to that of a cat on duty at a mouse-hole;
but he had expected no such progress as this. “It’s amazing—you
have scarcely any more accent now in English
than in Spanish. I’ll be glad to coach you. What you just
said was QX except for the last sentence. Idiomatically,
you should have said ‘I’m coming along, but I’m not there
yet,’ ” and Cloud explained in detail. “Now, for practice,
brief me on this job we’ve got here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thankz a lot. Tommie’s brother, whom we’ll call Jim,
runs a tobacco zhop here in town.” Cloud had had to
explain what “briefing” meant, and he corrected many
slight errors which are not given here. “A man who called
himself ‘Number One’ organized a Protective Azzoziazion.
Anyone not joining, he zaid, would zuffer the conzequenzez
of a looze atomic vortex in his power plant. When he
zhowed he meant buzzinez by exploding one right where
and when he zaid he would, many merchants joined and
began to pay. Jim did not. Inztead, he .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I forget the
idiom?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Stalled.’ That means delayed, played for time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yez. Jim ztalled, and Tommie went looking for
help, knowing the government here thoroughly corrupt.
Impozzible to alleviate intolerable zituazion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>What</span> a vocabulary!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Iz wrong?” Vesta demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, is <span class='it'>right</span>,” Cloud assured her. “I was complimenting
you, young lady—you’ll be teaching <span class='it'>me</span> English before
this trip is over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The class in English Conversation went on until the
Manarkan warned its two participants to get ready; that
Tommie, having identified the gangster, had left the lobby,
had joined her brother, and was bringing him with her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that safe, do you think?” Vesta asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For now, before anything starts, yes.” Cloud replied.
“After tonight, no.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tomingans arrived; Vesta let them in and introduced
Jim to Nadine and Cloud. The brother was taller,
heavier, craggier than the sister; his cigar was longer,
thicker, and blacker than hers. Otherwise, they were very
much alike. Cloud waved them both into comfortable
chairs, for there was no time for conversation. Nadine
began to write; Vesta to record.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Big Shot—Nadine took an instant to flash into
Cloud’s mind a very good picture of the fellow—was in
his private room, but if a dinner were to be on the
program it would be later. There were two men in the
room; Number One and another man, whom he thought
of and spoke to as “Number Nine.” At present the affair
was strictly business. Number Nine was handing money to
Number One, who was making notes in a book. Twenty
credits from Number Seventeen; 50 from No. 20; 25 from
No. 26; 175 from No. 29; 19 credits—all he could raise—from
No. 30; 125 from No. 31, and so on.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gangsters thought that they were being very smart
and cagey in using numbers instead of names, but neither
had any idea of the power of a really good telepathic
mind, or of that of a really good linguist. Each of those
numbers meant something to either or to both of those
men, and whatever it was—a name, a picture, a storefront
or address, or a fleeting glimpse of personality pattern—Nadine
seized and transmitted, either in shorthand
or by force of mind, or both; and Vesta taped, in machine-gun-fast
Spanish, every written word and every nuance
of thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The list was long. At its end:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Three more didn’t pay up, huh? The same ones holding
out as last time, and three more besides, huh?” This was
Number One, thinking deeply. “I don’t like it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Ninety
Two, huh? I don’t like it a bit—or him, either. I’ll have to
do something about him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yeah. Ninety Two. The others all give the same old
tear-jerker that they didn’t have it, that our assessments
were too stiff for their take, and so on, but Ninety Two
didn’t, this time. He simply blew his top. He was hotter
than the business end of a blow-torch.” Not much to
Cloud’s surprise, Nadine at this point poured into his mind
the picture of excessively angry Jim. “Not only he didn’t
fork over, he told me to tell you something.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a long pause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, spill it!” Number One barked. “What did he
say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall I give it to you straight boss, or maybe I better
tone it down some?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Straight!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He said for you to go roast, for fourteen thousand
years, in the hottest corner you can find of the hottest hell
of Telemachia, and take your Srizonified association with
you. Take your membership papers and stick ’em. Blow
his place up and be damned to you, he says. If you kill
him in the blast he’s left stuff in a deposit box that’ll blow
all the Srizonified crooked politicians and lawmen in the
Fourth Continent off of their perches and down onto their
Srizonified butts. An’ if you <span class='it'>don’t</span> get him, he says, he’ll
come after you with blasters in both hands. Make it plain,
he says, that it’s <span class='it'>you</span> he’ll be after—not me. That’s exactly
what he told me to tell you, boss.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me? ME?” Number One demanded. The towering
rage, which he had been scarcely able to control, subsided
into a warily intense speculation. “How did he find out
about <span class='it'>me</span>? Somebody’ll burn for this!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I dunno, boss, but it looks like you said a mouthful
about having to do something about him. We got to make
an example of <span class='it'>somebody</span>, boss—or else—in my book it’d
better be 92. He’s organizing, sure as hell, and if we don’t
knock him off it’ll spread fast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hm .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. m .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. m. Yes, but just him personally, not his
place. I’m not afraid of any evidence he can leave, of
itself, but in connection with the other thing it might be
bad. His place is too big; too centrally located. No matter
what time of night it goes off it’ll kill too many people and
do too much damage. Yellow Castle might dump us instead
of trying to ride out such a storm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yeah, they might, at that. Prob’ly would. And the
dogooders might get some of them Srizonified Lensmen in
here besides. But an ordinary bomb would do the job.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. Got to be a vortex. We promised ’em an atomic
flare, so that’s what it’s got to be. It doesn’t have to be 92,
though. We can get away easy enough with killing a few
people, so I’d say somebody in the outskirts—53 would be
as good as any. So tell 53 his place gets it at midnight
tomorrow night, and the fewer people in it the more will
stay alive.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Check. And I’ll take care of 92?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course. You don’t have to be told <span class='it'>every</span> move to
make.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just wanted to make sure, is all. What do I do in the
big fireworks?” It was clear that the underling was intensely
curious about the phenomenon, but his curiosity was
not to be satisfied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing,” his chief informed him flatly. “That isn’t
your dish. Now we’ll eat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Number One stopped talking, but he did not stop thinking;
and Nadine could read, and Vesta could transcribe,
thoughts as well as words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Besides, it’s about time for 31 to earn some of the
credits we’re paying him,” was the grimly savage thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This thought was accompanied by a picture, which
Nadine spread in full in Cloud’s mind. A tall, lean, gray
Tellurian was aiming a mechanism—the details of which
were so vague that it could have been anything from a
vest-pocket flash-pencil up to a half-track mobile projector—at
a power-plant, which immediately and enthusiastically
went out of control in a blindingly incandescent flare
of raw energy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fairchild!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cloud’s mind raced. That vortex on Deka <span class='it'>hadn’t</span> been
accidental, then, even though there had been no evidence—no
suspicion—even the Lensmen hadn’t guessed that the
radiationist had been anything other than a very minor
cog in Graves’ thionite-producing machine! Nobody except
Fairchild knew what he did or how he did it—the
mob must have tried to find out, too, but he wouldn’t
give—but this stuff was very definitely for the future; not
for now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“QX, girls. A nice job—thanks,” he said. “Now, Vesta,
please tape the actual facts and the actual words of the
interview—none of the pictures or guesses—in Middle
Plateau Tomingan. Wherever possible, bracket real names
and addresses with the code numbers. Tommie and Jim
can help you on that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they came to that part of the transcription
dealing with Number Ninety Two, Jim stiffened and
swelled in rage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ask him if that’s an accurate report,” Cloud directed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s accurate enough as far as it goes,” Jim boomed.
His voice, deeper and louder than Tommie’s, and not
nearly as musical, almost shook the walls. “But he left out
half of it. What I really told him would have burned all
the tape off of that recorder.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But they left in that .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that awful one, three times.”
Tommie, tough as she was, was shocked. “You ought to
be ashamed of yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Srizonified?” Cloud whispered to Vesta. “It sounded
bad, but not <span class='it'>that</span> hot. Is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, the hottest in the language. I never saw it in
print, and heard it only once, and that was by accident.
Like most such things, though, it doesn’t translate—‘descended
from countless generations of dwellers in stinking,
unflowering mud’ is as close as I can come to it in
Spanish.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“QX. Finish up the tape and make two copies of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the copies were ready Cloud handed them to
Tommie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell him to take one of these down to the Tomingan
equivalent of the D. A.’s office the first thing in the
morning,” he instructed Vesta. “The other ought to go to
a big law firm—an honest one, if she knows of any. Now
ask Jim what he thinks he’s going to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going to get a pair of blasters and.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yeah?” Cloud’s biting monosyllable, so ably translated
by the Vegian, stopped him in mid-sentence. “What
chance do you think you stand of getting home tonight in
one piece? Your copter is probably mined right now, and
they’ve undoubtedly made arrangements to blast you if
you leave here any other way, even on foot. If you want
to stay alive, though, I’ve got a suggestion to make.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may be right, sir.” Jim’s bluster died away as he
began really to think. “Do you see a way out?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Ordinary citizens don’t wear armor here, any
more than anywhere else, so ordinary gangsters don’t use
semi-portables. So, when you leave here, go to Tommie’s
room instead of out. They’ll lay for you, of course, but
while they’re waiting Tommie will go out to our ship and
bring back my G-P armor. You put it on, walk out
openly, and take a ground-car—<span class='it'>not</span> a copter—to the ship.
If they know armor they won’t shoot at you, because you
could shoot back. When you get to the ship go in, lock the
port behind you, and stay there until I tell you to come
out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim, influenced visibly by the pleasant possibility of
shooting back, accepted the plan joyously; and, after making
sure that there were no spies or spy-rays on watch, the
two Tomingans left the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few minutes later, with the same precaution, Vesta
and the Manarkan went to their own rooms; but they
were on hand again after breakfast next morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know, of course, that you have no evidence admissible
in even an honest court,” Nadine began. “You
knew it when you changed your mind about having a
Tomingan voice, not Vesta’s, on those tapes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Communicator-taps are out—violation of privacy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exactly. And telepathy is worse. Any attempt to introduce
telepathic testimony, on almost any non-telepathic
world, does more harm than good. So, beyond establishing
the fact of guilt in your own mind—a fact already self-evident,
since such outrages can happen only when both
courts and police are corrupt from top to bottom—I fail
to see what you hope to gain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wouldn’t a Tomingan Lensman be interested?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are none. There never have been any.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then, I’ll take it up myself, with.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cloud stopped in mid-thought. With whom? He could
talk to Phil Strong, certainly, but he wouldn’t get anywhere.
He knew, as well as Nadine did, that the Galactic
Patrol would not interfere with purely local politics unless
something of inter-systemic scope was involved. The
Galactic Council held, and probably rightly, that any people
got the kind of local government they deserved. He
certainly couldn’t expect the Patrol to over-ride planetary
sovereignty in regard to a thing that hadn’t happened yet!
He wrenched his mind away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Having any trouble following her, Nadine?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. She’s just leaving the fast-way now; going into his
office.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, through Nadine, Cloud accompanied Tommie
into the office of the District Attorney, saw her tender the
spool of tape, heard her explain in stormy language what
it was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How did you get hold of it?” the D. A. demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you suppose?” Tommie shot back. “Do we
have to come down to City Hall and take out a license to
hang an ear onto such a stinking crumb, such a notorious
mobster and general all-round heel as Number One is?
Public Enemy Number One, it ought to be!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I wouldn’t say that you would,” the politician
soothed. He had been thinking fast. “I’ll run this tape as
soon as I can take a minute alone in my chambers, and I
promise you full and fast action. They’ve gone too far,
this time. Just what, specifically, do you want me to do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m no lawyer, so I don’t know who does what, but I
want this Protective Association junked and I want those
murderers arrested. Today.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some of these matters lie outside the province of this
office, but I can and will take initiatory steps. No one will
be harmed, I assure you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Apparently satisfied, Tommie left the D. A.’s office, but
Nadine did not leave the D. A.’s mind. This was what the
Blaster was after!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sure enough, as soon as Tommie was out of sight, the
official dashed into his private office and called Number
One.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One, they hung an ear on you last night!” he exclaimed,
as soon as connection was made. “How come you
didn’t.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Horsefeathers!” the gangster snarled. “Who d’ya think
you’re kidding?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But they did! I’ve got a copy of it right here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Play it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tape was played, and it was very clear that it was in
no Tomingan’s voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, it wasn’t an ear,” the D. A. admitted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I was blocked against spy-rays,” said Number
One, “so it must have been a snooper. A snooper with a
voice. Manarkans are snoopers, but they can’t talk. Most
snoopers can’t .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. except maybe Ordoviks. There were a
couple of them around last night. Can Ordoviks talk? And
Chickladorians—are they snoopers?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know either, but I’ll find out, and when I do I’ll
go gunning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tommie came back to Cloud’s room and her serenity,
skin-deep at best, vanished completely as the new tape was
played.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Condemn and blast that lying, slimy, two-faced, double-crossing
snake!” she roared. “I’ll call out the.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You won’t either—pipe down!” Cloud ordered, sharply.
“Mob rule never settled anything. That’s what you
expected, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. more or less, I suppose .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“QX. We got <span class='it'>something</span> to work on now, but we need
more, and we’ve got only today to get it. Who’s the
crookedest judge in town—the one most apt to be in on
this kind of a deal?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Trellis. High Judge Rose Trellis of the Enchanting.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Skip the embellishments. Take both of these tapes to
Judge Trellis and <span class='it'>insist</span> on seeing him at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t a him—she’s a her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Her, then. Make it snappy. And don’t blow up if she
gives you the brush-off. We’re after data. And on your
way back, pick up that newspaper editor and bring him
along.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='89' id='Page_89'></span><h1 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>Chapter 9</span><br/> ▂▂▂▂▂▂<span style='font-size:larger'>TROUBLE ON TOMINGA</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'>TOMMIE LEFT, accompanied mentally by Nadine, and
reached the judge’s antechamber; with Vesta taping in
Middle-Plateau Tomingan everything that occurred. The
approach was difficult, and Tommie’s temper grew shorter
and shorter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get out of my way!” she bellowed finally at the sergeant-at-arms
barring her way to the judicial Presence, in a
voice that rattled the windows and was audible above four
blocks of city traffic. “Or shoot, if you want to get yourself
and this building and half of Mingia blown clear
up into the stratosphere! Jump! Before I take that blaster
and shove it so far down your throat it’ll hit day-before-yesterday’s
breakfast!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The guard did not have quite enough nerve to shoot,
and Tommie almost wrenched the door of the judge’s inner
office off its hinges as she went in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s this, pray? Get out! Sergeant-at.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shut up, Rose Trellis of the Enchanting Vistas of
Exotic Blooms—you’re listening, not talking. Here’s two
tapes of what Number One and his misbegotten scum
have been doing. Play ’em! And then <span class='it'>do something</span> about
’em! And listen, you lying, double-crossing, back-biting
slime-lizard!” Tommie’s prettily-made-up face was in
shocking contrast to the venemous fury in Tommie’s eyes
as she leaned over the judge’s massive desk until nose was
a scant ten inches from nose. “If that atomic blast goes
off tonight you and your whole Srizonified crew will wish
to all your devils you’d never been born!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whirling around, Tommie strode out; nor did anyone
attempt to stop her. No one knew what would happen if
they did; and no one cared to find out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Judge Trellis did not play the tapes. In panic fashion
she called the District Attorney, who promptly made it a
three-way with Number One. The three talked busily for
minutes, then met in person, together with several lesser
lights, in a heavily-guarded room. This conference, the
subject matter of which was so obvious as to require no
detailing here, went on for a long time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So long, in fact, that Tommie and the newspaper man
got back to Cloud’s hotel room while Vesta was still taping
a word-by-word report of the proceedings. Tommie was
subdued, almost apologetic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know you told me not to blow up, Captain Cloud,
but they made me so mad I couldn’t help it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In this case just as well you did; maybe better. You
scared her into calling a meeting, and they’ve spilled every
bean in the pot. We’ve got exactly what we wanted—enough
to stop that gang right in its tracks. Now, as soon
as the girls get the last of it, we’ll let your editor in on it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was soon over, and Cloud, after a quick run-down of
the situation and a play-back of parts of the tapes for the
newshawk’s benefit, concluded:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So, over the long pull, the issue isn’t—can’t be—in
doubt. Public opinion will be aroused. There are honest
judges, there are a lot of honest cops. At the next election
this corrupt regime will be thrown out of office. However,
that election is a year away, the present powers-that-be
are all in the syndicate, and we must do something <span class='it'>today</span>
to stop the destruction scheduled for tonight. Little Flower-and-so-on
tells me that you’re a crusading type, fighting
a losing battle against this mob—that they’ve got you just
about whipped—so I thought you would be interested in
taking a slug at ’em by getting out an extra—strong
enough to stir up enough public sentiment so they wouldn’t
dare go ahead. Would you like to do that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would I?” The newsman grinned wolfishly. “I’ll get out
the extra, yes; but I’ll do a lot more than that. I’ll print a
hundred thousand dodgers and drop ’em from copters. I’ll
have blimps dragging streamers all over the sky. I’ll buy
time on every radio and tri-di station in town—have the
juiciest bits of these tapes broadcast, every hour on the
hour. Mister, I’ll tear this town wide open before sundown
tonight!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He left, breathing fire and sulphurous smoke, and Cloud
made motions to attract the Manarkan’s attention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nadine? These Tomingans take things big, don’t they?
All to the good, with one exception—will any repercussions—flarebacks—hit
you? Those characters are tough,
and will be desperate, and I wouldn’t want to put you in
line with a blaster.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. almost certainly not,” Nadine replied, after a
minute of thought. “They are looking for a telepath with a
voice, which they won’t find on Tominga. They know
Manarkans well—many of us live here permanently—and
I’m quite sure that none of the gang would suspect such
an unheard-of thing as Vesta and I have been doing. They
are not imaginative, and such a thing never happened
before—not here, at least.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No? Why not? What’s strange about it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The whole situation is new—unique. This is probably
the first time in history that these exact circumstances—especially
in regard to personnel—have come together.
Consider, please, the ingredients: a real and bitter grievance,
victims willing and anxious to take drastic action, a
sympathetic telepath who is also an expert in shorthand, a
master linguist, and, above all, a director or programmer—you—both
able and willing to fit the parts together so
that they work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Um .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. m .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. m. Never thought of it in that way.
Could be, I guess. Well, all we can do now is wait and see
what happens.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They waited, and saw. The crusading editor did everything
he had promised. The extra hit the streets, its headlines
screaming “CORRUPTION!” in the biggest type possible
to use. The taped conversations, with names,
amounts, times, and places, were printed in full. The
accompanying editorial should have been written with
sulphuric acid on asbestos paper. The leaflets, gaily littering
the city, were even more vitriolic. Every hour, on the
hour, speakers gave out what sound-trucks were blaring
continuously—irrefutable proof that the city of Mingia
was being run by a corrupt, rotten, vicious machine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mingia’s citizens responded, but not quite as enthusiastically
as the Blaster, from his limited acquaintance with the
breed, had expected. There was some organizing, some
demonstrating; but there was also quite a lot of “So what?
If they don’t, some other gang of politicians will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cloud, however, when he went to his rooms after supper,
was well pleased with what he had seen. They
<span class='it'>couldn’t</span> blast 53, not after the events of the afternoon.
The Chickladorians and Vesta and Nadine, when they
came in, agreed with him. The situation was under control.
They were tired, they said. It had been a long, hard
day, and they were going to hit the sack. They left.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cloud intended to stay awake until midnight, just to see
what would happen, but he didn’t. He was tired, too, and
within a couple of minutes after he relaxed, alone, he was
sound asleep in his chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus he did not hear the vicious thunder-clap of the
atomic explosion at midnight; did not see the reflected
brilliance of its glare. Nor did he hear the hurrying footsteps
in the hotel’s corridors. What woke him up was the
concussion that jarred the whole neighborhood when a
half-ton bomb demolished the building which had been
Number One’s headquarters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cloud jumped up, then, and ran out into the hall and
along it to Vesta’s room. He pounded. No answer. The
door was unlocked. He opened it. Vesta was not there!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nadine was gone, too. So were the Chickladorians.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rushed up to the lobby, only to encounter again the
difficulty that had stopped him short before. <span class='it'>He could not
make himself understood!</span> He didn’t know three words of
Upper Plateau, and nobody he could find knew even one
word of English, Spanish, Spaceal, or any other language
at his command.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took an elevator down to the street level and flagged
a cruising cab. He handed the driver the largest Tomingan
bill he had; then, pointing straight ahead and making
furious pushing motions, he made it plain that he knew
where he wanted to go, and wanted to get there in a
hurry. The hacker, stimulated by more cash than he had
seen for a week, drove wherever Cloud pointed; and
broke—or at least bent—most of Mingia’s speed-laws in
his eagerness to oblige.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cloud’s destination, of course, was the spaceport; but
when he got to the <span class='it'>Vortex Blaster I</span>, Jim wasn’t there any
more. None of his crew was aboard, either. The lifeboats
were all in place, but the flitter was gone. So were both
suits of armor—and the semi-portables—and the spare
DeLameters—and both needles—even his space-hatchet!</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went up to the control room and glanced over the
board. Everything was on zero except one meter, which
was grazing the red. All four semis and both needles were
running wide open—pulling every watt they could possibly
draw!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Angry as he was, Cloud did not think of cutting the
circuit. If he had thought of it he wouldn’t have done it.
He didn’t know exactly what his officers were doing, of
course, but he could do a shrewd job of guessing. If he
had known what they were up to he wouldn’t have permitted
it, but it was too late to do anything about it now.
With those terrific weapons in operation they <span class='it'>might</span> get
back alive—without them, they certainly would not. <span class='it'>What</span>
a land-office business those semis were doing!</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tommie and her brother, wearing Cloud’s two suits of
armor, were each <span class='it'>carrying</span> a semi-portable; wielding it, if
not as easily as an Earthly gunner wields a sub-machine-gun,
much more effectively. They were burning down a
thick steel door. Well behind them, the third semi was
bathing the whole front of the building in a blinding glare
of radiance. In back, the fourth was doing the same to the
rear wall. On the sides, the two needle-beams were darting
from window to window, burning to a crisp any gangster
gunner daring to show his head to aim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the Tomingans had not been nearly as optimistic as
had Cloud, and they had made complete preparation for
reprisal in case Number One should make good his threat.
The Manarkan had been willing to cooperate. Thlaskin,
ditto. Vesta had been quiveringly eager. Maluleme had
gone along. They had not mutinied—they simply did not
tell Cloud a thing about what they were going to do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Number One had not been in his headquarters, of
course, when that thousand-pound bomb let go. He
thought himself safe—but he wasn’t. Nadine the telepath
knew exactly where he was and exactly what he was
doing. Vesta the linguist poured the information along, via
the flitter’s broadcaster, to the receivers of hundreds of
ground-cars and copters far below. Thlaskin the Master
Pilot kept the flitter close enough to the fleeing Number
One so that Nadine could read him—fully, she thought—but
far enough away to avoid detection. Thus, wherever
he went, Number One was pursued relentlessly, and his
merciless pursuers closed in faster and faster.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Number One’s flight, however, was not aimless. He
knew that a snooper was on him, and had enough power
of mind to shield a few highly important thoughts. He
wasn’t really THE Big Shot. He had called Yellow Castle,
though, and they had told him that he could come in in
one hour—the army would be ready. But did he have an
hour, or not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did; just barely. The saps were snapping at his heels
when he switched to a jet job and took off in a screaming
straight line for the Castle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vesta wanted to ram him to drop a lifeboat on him, to
wreck him in any way possible; but Thlaskin refused.
Captain Cloud would be mad enough at what they’d done
already—any such rough stuff as <span class='it'>that</span> would be altogether
too damn much! And, since the rebels’ jets were still on
the ground, Number One had reached sanctuary unharmed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yellow Castle, however, was not as impregnable as the
gangsters had supposed. They had armor, true, but it was
not at all like Cloud’s. They had weapons, true, but
nothing even faintly resembling the frightful semi-portable
projectors of the Galactic Patrol—nothing even remotely
approaching the Patrol’s beam-fed needle beams.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus the Tomingans, Tommie and Jim, stood in armor
of proof scarcely an arm’s length from Yellow Castle’s
heavy steel door and burned it down into a brooklet of
molten metal. Then on in; blasting down everything that
resisted and, finally, everything that moved. Nor did any
gangster escape. Those who managed to avoid the armored
pair were blasted by one of the other semis or
speared by one of the needles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yellow Castle, already furiously ablaze, was left to
burn. Jim, after giving instructions as to how his lieutenants
were to dispose of such small fry as might be left
alive in the city proper, helped his sister load the Blaster’s
weapons and armor into a ground-car. They drove out
into the middle of a great open field. The flitter landed;
Cloud’s borrowed equipment was hauled aboard. Tommie
and Jim followed it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you were really smart, I think you’d flit right now,”
Vesta said to Tommie. “Captain Cloud isn’t going to like
this a little bit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know it. I’m not smart. This was worth anything he
cares to do about it. Besides, I want to thank him myself
and tell him good-bye in person.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The flitter took off and returned to her mother-ship.
Tommie and Thlaskin put her away, then the peculiarly
assorted six went up to the control room and faced the
quietly seething Tellurian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not boldly—only Tommie and Nadine were really at
ease. Jim was defiant. Thlaskin was nervous and apprehensive;
Maluleme was just plain scared. So was Vesta—her
tail drooped to the floor; she seemed to have shrunk to
four-fifths her normal size; her usual free-swinging, buoyant
gait had changed almost to a slink.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cloud stared at Nadine—chill, stern, aloof; an up-to-date
Joan of Arc or a veritable destroying angel—nodded
at her to synchronize with his mind. She did so, and her
mind bore out everything implied by her attitude and expression.
She was outraged to her innermost fiber by the
conditions she had just helped to correct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were the prime operator in this thing,” he
thought, flatly. “With your knowledge of law and your
supposed respect for it, how could you take it into your
own hands? Become part of a law-breaking mob?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was necessary. Law in Mingia was shackled—completely
inoperative. We freed it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By murder?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was not murder. The lives of all who were killed
were already forfeit. The corrupt judges, officials, and
police officers will be dealt with by Mingian law, now
again operative. Of all your crew, only Tommie could by
any chance have been taken or recognized. If our coup
had failed, she and Jim would have been shot without
trial. Since we succeeded, however, Tommie was not recognized,
being in your armor, and Jim is now Mingia’s
hero. He is also the new Commissioner of Police. Hence,
aside from breaking local laws—which, as I have explained,
do not count—we are guilty only of unauthorized
use of Patrol equipment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Huh? How about interfering in planetary affairs, the
worst in the book? And revealing Stage Ten stuff to a
Stage Eight planet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are wrong on both counts,” Nadine informed
him. “We were on shore leave—that fact is in the log. We
volunteered, purely as individuals, for one day of service
in the Underground. This procedure, while of course forbidden
to armed personnel of the Patrol, is perfectly legal
to its civilian employees. A special ruling would have to be
made to cover this particular incident, and no <span class='it'>ex post
facto</span> penalties could be imposed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s quibbling if I ever heard any, but you’re probably
right—legally—at that. But how do you wiggle out of
the ‘revealing’ charge?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the specific meaning of the word, as defined by the
highest courts, nothing was revealed. Weapons and armor
were seen, of course; but they have been seen on Tominga
before. Nothing new was learned; hence there was no
revealment. And as for Jim’s leaving the ship against your
orders, you had no right to issue such orders in the first
place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still seething, but on a considerably lower level, Cloud
pondered. It <span class='it'>wasn’t</span> murder—nobody would or could call
it that. “Extermination” would be more like it—or “justifiable
germicide.” She was probably right on the rest of it,
too. Even though he was, by virtue of being the captain of
the <span class='it'>Vortex Blaster I</span>, an officer of the Patrol—strictly
speaking a commander, not a captain—there wasn’t a
thing in the world he could do about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nadine had been keeping Vesta posted; and the latter,
recovering miraculously her wonted spirit and with tail
again aloft, was passing the good news along to the others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t get <span class='it'>too</span> cocky, sister!” Tommie advised her
sharply. “Not yet, anyway.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Huh?” Vesta’s tail dropped to half-mast. “Why not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You just said she pleaded guilty for all of us to
unauthorized use of Patrol equipment. For what we really
did that’s certainly a featherweight plea—if I ever get into
a real jam I certainly want her for my lawyer—but he can
make it plenty tough for us if he wants to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I got a question to ask, boss,” Thlaskin put in, before
Cloud said anything. “You got a license to be sore as hell,
no argument about that, but I ask you—are you sore
mostly because we took the stuff or because we didn’t let
you in on it? We <span class='it'>couldn’t</span> do that, boss, and you know
why.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cloud did know why. The pilot had put his finger right
on the sore spot, and the Blaster was honest enough to
admit it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s it, I guess.” He grinned wryly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tommie, who had been whispering to Vesta, asked:
“You got back here while we were still sucking juice,
didn’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and as Nadine will undoubtedly point out if I
don’t, that fact makes me an accomplice for not pulling
the switches on you. So, already being an accessory during
and after the fact, I may as well go the route. If any of us
gets hauled up, we all do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No fear of that,” Tommie assured him. “One thing
Tomingans are good at is keeping their mouths shut.
Maluleme and Vesta will spill everything they know, and
brag about it, sooner or later,” the Vegian did not relish
translating this passage, but she did so, and accurately,
nevertheless, “but that won’t do any harm. It’s <span class='it'>you</span> that’s
in the driver’s seat. You could’ve nailed us all to the cross
if you liked, and I for one didn’t expect to get off easy.
Thanks. I’ll remember this. So will everybody else who
knows. You’re washing me out, of course?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not unless you want to stay here on Tominga. You’re
a good engineer, and I can’t picture this as happening
again, can you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hardly. I like this better than stationary work. Thanks
again, chief. My brother wants to thank you, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the sincerely grateful and appreciative Tomingan
had gone, Cloud said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Vesta and Maluleme—if Tommie was right about you
two having to talk, make a note of this. Don’t do it as
long as you’re members of this crew. If you do, I’ll fire
you the second I find out about it. Now everybody—as far
as I’m concerned none of this ever happened. We came
here to blow out vortices and that’s all we did. We’ll go
back to the hotel, get a few hours sleep, and.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The long-range communicator, silent for weeks, came
suddenly to life in English.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Calling space-ship <span class='it'>Vortex Blaster One</span>, Commander
Neal Cloud. Acknowledge, please. Calling space-ship <span class='it'>Vortex
Blaster One</span>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Space-ship <span class='it'>Vortex Blaster One</span> acknowledging.” The
detector-coupled projector had swung into exact alignment.
“Commander Cloud speaking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Space-ship YB216P9, of First Continent, Tominga,
relaying message from Philip Strong of Tellus. Will you
accept message?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will accept message. Ready.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Begin message. Report in person as soon as convenient.
Answer expected. End message. Signed Philip Strong.
Repeat, please. We will relay reply.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cloud repeated. Then: “Reply. To Philip Strong, Vortex
Control Laboratory, Tellus. Begin message. Remess.
Will leave Manarka fourteenth Sol for Tellus. End of
message. Signed Neal Cloud. Repeat, please.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That done, he turned to his crew. “Now we’ll <span class='it'>have</span> to
go to work!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With Vesta to translate, two days sufficed to rid Tominga
of her loose atomic vortices; and no one so much as
suspected that the Patrol ship or any of its crew had had
anything to do with the upheaval in Mingia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The trip to Manarka, a two-day flit, was uneventful. So
was the extinguishment of Manarka’s vortices.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the job was done, Nadine’s mind and Cloud’s met
briefly. No direct reference was made to the unpleasantness
on Tominga, nor to their somewhat variant ideas
concerning it. Nadine wanted to stay on. She liked the job
and she liked Cloud. He was somewhat impractical and
visionary, a bit too idealistic in his outlook at times; but a
strong and able man and a top-bracket commander, nevertheless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the Manarkan, in Cloud’s mind, was not only a
top-bracket medico, but also a <span class='it'>very</span> handy hand to have
around.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the fourteenth of Sol, then, the good ship <span class='it'>Vortex
Blaster I</span> took off for Tellus, with Cloud wondering more
than a little as to what was in the wind. He wasn’t the type
to be unduly perturbed about being called up on the
carpet <span class='it'>per se</span>; but Phil didn’t go in for mystery much—he
explained things .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He couldn’t possibly know anything
about that Mingian business so soon .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and he was going
to tell him all about it anyway.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was plenty of Laboratory business that shouldn’t
be relayed all over space, and this was undoubtedly some
of it. Whatever it was, it’d have to keep until he got to
Tellus, anyway, so he’d forget it until then.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he didn’t.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='99' id='Page_99'></span><h1 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>Chapter 10</span><br/> ▂▂▂▂▂▂<span style='font-size:larger'>JANOWICK</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'>BACK ON TELLUS, Cloud took a fast copter to the
Vortex Control Laboratory, still wondering what it was all
about.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go right in, Dr. Cloud,” Strong’s secretary told him,
even before he stopped at her desk. “He’s been gnawing
his nails ever since you landed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cloud went in. The Lensman was not alone; a woman
who had been seated beside the desk was now standing,
studying him eagerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hi, Phil,” the Blaster said. “Why all the haste, and why
so cryptic? I’ve been wondering if you found where I hid
the body—and which body it was.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hi, Storm. Nothing like that!” Strong laughed. “Doctor
Janowick, Doctor Cloud—or rather, Joan, this is Storm.
You know all about him that anybody does.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They shook hands, Cloud wondering all the more, and
as he wondered he studied the woman, just as she was
studying him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Janowick? <span class='it'>Janowick!</span> He’d never heard of any female
Janowick, so she couldn’t be anybody much in nucleonics.
Not exactly fat, but definitely on the plump side. About a
hundred and thirty-five pounds, he guessed; and about five
feet two. About his own age—no, a bit younger, thirty-some,
probably. Brown hair, with a few white ones
showing; wide-spaced gray eyes—slightly myopic, by the
looks of her pixeyish, you-be-damned spectacles. Smart
and keen—all in all, a prime number.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is why I pulled you in, Storm,” the Lensman went
on. “As you know, we’ve been combing all Civilization,
trying to find somebody—anybody—with enough of the
right qualities. She’s it. Head of the Department of Semantics
at the Galactic Institute for Advanced Study.
Doctor of Semantics, Ph.D. in cybernetics, D.Sc. in symbolic
logic, and so on for half the alphabet. She is also a
very good self-made telepath, and the only self-made
perceiver I ever heard of. She’s very good at that, too—she
can outrange a Rigellian. And besides all that, she’s a
Past Grand Master at chess.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Past</span> Grand Master? Oh, I see—I don’t suppose it
<span class='it'>would</span> be quite <span class='it'>de rigueur</span> for a top-bracket telepath to
win all the Grand Masters’ championships. Also, in view
of the perception business, I imagine all this is more than
somewhat hush-hush?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very much so. A few Lensmen and now you are all
who are in on it. It’ll have to stay top secret until we find
out whether an ordinary mind can be developed into one
like yours, or whether her brain, like yours, is something
out of the ordinary.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it’d be very bad to have billions of people screaming
for a treatment that can’t be given.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Check. But to get back to Joan. She’s done some
almost unbelievable work and we think she’ll do. You
know what we’re after, of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All I’m afraid of is that you haven’t looked far enough,”
the woman said, shaking her head dubiously. “You know,
though, what an appalling job it was bound to be. I’ll do
whatever I can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did not state the problem, either. They all knew, too
well, what it was. As matters then stood, the life of one
man—Neal Cloud—was all that stood between Civilization
and loose atomic vortices; and it was starkly unthinkable
that the Galactic Patrol would leave, for a second
longer than was absolutely necessary, that situation unremedied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see.” Cloud broke the short silence. “Assuming that
you haven’t been sitting still doing nothing while I’ve been
gone, brief me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Smart boy!” Strong applauded. “The first thing Joan
did was to figure out that a nine-second prediction was out
of the question for any computer, digital or analogue,
possible to build with today’s knowledge. Asked us what
we could do to cut the time and how far we could cut it.
With your little bombing flitter you have to have about
nine seconds because you have to build up your speed to
the required initial velocity of the bomb. That could be
done away with, of course, by firing the bomb out of a
Q-gun or something.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you’d have to have a special ship, much bigger
than a flitter!” Cloud protested. “And special guns .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and
the special pointers for those guns—or for the ship, if the
guns were fixed-aligned—would be ver<span class='it'>ee</span> unsimple, believe
me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How right you are, Buster! Other things, too, that you
haven’t thought of yet, such as automatic compensation
for air conditions and so on. Very much worth while,
however, and all done—we’ve had a lot of people on this
project. But to cut this short, the necessary ship turned
out to be a scout cruiser; the minimum safe distance—assuming
worst possible conditions and heaviest possible
screening—is thirty two hundred meters.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait a minute!” Cloud broke in. “I’ve worked closer
than that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You got badly burned once, too, remember; and, according
to the medics, you’ve been taking some damage
since. You won’t from here on. But to resume; since the
muzzle velocity we can use is limited, by the danger of
prematuring on impact, to nine hundred sixteen meters
per second, the time from circuit-closing to detonation is
something over three and a half seconds—how much over
depending on atmospheric conditions. That’s absolutely the
best we can do, so we gave Joan a minimum of three
point six seconds of prediction to shoot at with her mechanical
brains. She isn’t quite there yet, but she’s far
enough along so that she has to work with you, on actual
blasting, the rest of the way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?” Cloud argued. “If she stayed on the high side
there’d be no danger of scattering; only of intensification,
which wouldn’t do any harm out in the badlands.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Too chancy.” The Lensman swept Cloud’s argument
aside with a wave of his hand. “So the quicker you get
moved into your new ship, the <span class='it'>Vortex Blaster Two</span>, and
get your practicing done, the sooner the two of you can
be on your way to Chickladoria. Flit!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just as you say, chief. Here’s my report in full. Some
of the stuff will jar you to the teeth; particularly Fairchild
and the fact that every blow-up that has ever happened
has been deliberate, not accidental.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Huh? <span class='it'>Deliberate!</span> Have you blown your stack completely,
Storm?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Uh-uh; but the proof is too long and involved to go
into offhand. You’ll have to get it from the tapes and it’ll
take you at least a week to check my math. Besides, you
told us to flit. So come on, Joan—clear ether, Phil!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Blaster and his new assistant left the laboratory;
and in the copter, en route to the field, Cloud wondered
momentarily what it was about the Lensman’s explanation
that had not rung quite true. The first sight of his new
vessel’s control room, however, banished the unformed
thought from his mind before it had taken any real root.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='pindent'>The transformed scout cruiser <span class='it'>Vortex Blaster II</span> hung
poised and motionless over the badlands. The optical systems
and beam-antennae and receptors of dozens of instruments,
many of which were only months old, were
focused sharply upon the loose atomic vortex a scant two
miles distant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few of these instruments reported only to a small and
comparatively simple integrator which, after classifying
and combining the incoming signals, put out as end-product
the thin, black, violently-fluctuating line which
was the sigma curve. Some others reported only to a
massive mechanism, too heavy for any smaller vessel to
carry, upon whose electronic complexities there is no need
to dwell. Most of the information-gathering instruments,
however, reported to both integrator and computer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not strapped down into a shock-absorber, but sitting
easily in an ordinary pilot’s bucket, quietly but supremely
intent, “Storm” Cloud concentrated upon his sigma curve;
practically oblivious to everything else. Without knowing
how he did it he was solving continuously the simultaneous
differential equations of the calculus of warped surfaces;
extrapolating the sigma curve to an ever-moving instant of
time three and nine-tenths seconds—the flight-time of the
bombs plus his own reaction time—ahead of the frantic
pen-point of the chart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In his flitter, where he had required a nine-&nbsp;or ten-second
prediction, he had always seized the first acceptable
match that appeared. Now, however, needing only to
extrapolate to less than four seconds, his technique was
entirely different. He was now matching, from instant to
instant, the predicted value of the curve against one or
another of the twelve bombs lying in the firing chambers
of heavy guns whose muzzles ringed the cruiser’s needle-sharp
nose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, as he had been doing ever since beginning to work
with Joan and her mechanical brains, he was passing up
match after match, waiting to see whether or not the
current brain could deliver the goods. There had been a
long succession of them—Alice, Betty, Candace, Deirdre,
and so on. This one was Lulu, and it didn’t look as though
she was any good, either. He waited a while longer,
however; then fined down his figures and got ready to
blast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The flight-time of the bomb, under present atmospheric
conditions, would be three point five nine eight seconds,
plus or minus point zero zero one. His reaction time was
point zero eight nine.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Storm!” Joan broke in sharply, “Can you hold up
a minute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That reaction time. I never spotted that before. Why
didn’t I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know. Never thought of it. Lumped it in, you
know. Separated it now, I suppose, because I’m working
so slowly, to give Lulu more of a chance. Why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because I’ve <span class='it'>got</span> to know all the odd things about you,
and that isn’t merely odd; it’s superhuman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I wouldn’t say that. Chickladorians average about
point zero eight, and Vegians are still faster, about point
zero seven. I checked up on that because they always test
me three times when I renew my driver’s license and
always pull a wise crack about me having a lot of cat
blood in me. S’pose I could have?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Um .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. m .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. m. Probably not .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I don’t know for
sure, but I don’t believe that a Tellurian-Vegian cross
would be possible; and even if possible, such a hybrid
couldn’t very well be fertile. But the more I find out about
you, my friend, the more convinced I become that you’re
either a mutant or else have some ancestors who were
most decidedly <span class='it'>not</span> Tellurians. But excuse this interruption,
please—go ahead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cloud went. The flight time of the bomb, under present
atmospheric conditions, would be three point five nine two
seconds, plus or minus point zero zero two. His reaction
time was point zero eight nine. In three point six eight one
seconds the activity of the vortex would match bomb
number eleven to within one-tenth of one percent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His left hand flashed out, number eleven firing stud
snapped down. The vessel shuddered as though struck by a
trip-hammer as the precisely-weighed charge of propellant
heptadetonite went off. The bomb sped truly, in both
space and time. There was a detonation that jarred the
planet to its core, a flare of light many times brighter than
the sun at noon, a shock-wave that wrought havoc for
miles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the scout cruiser and her occupants were unharmed.
Completely inertialess, invulnerable, the vessel rode effortlessly
away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Neal Cloud glanced into his plate; turned his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Out,” he said, seemingly unnecessarily. “How’d Lulu
work, Joan?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better, but not good enough. She was on track all the
way, but three point three was the best she could get .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
and I was <span class='it'>sure</span> we had it licked this time .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. oh, <span class='it'>damn</span>!”
The voice broke, ending almost in a wail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Steady, Joan!” Cloud was surprised at his companion’s
funk. “Only three tenths of a second to get yet, is all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Only</span> three tenths—what d’you mean, <span class='it'>only</span>?” the woman
snapped. “Don’t you know that those three tenths of a
second are just about in the same class as the three
thousandths of a degree just above zero absolute?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure I do, but I know you, too. You’re really blasting,
little chum. Both Jane and Katy, you remember, were just
as apt to be off track as on. You’ll get it, Joan. As Vesta
says, ‘Tail high sister!’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks, Storm. I needed that. You see, to keep her on
track we had to put in more internal memory banks and
that slowed her down .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we’ll have to dream up some
way of getting the information out of those banks faster.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you tinker her—what’ll the next version be? Margie?—up
en route, or do you want to keep this ship near
Sol while you work on it? Phil tells me I’ve got to flit for
Chickladoria—and chop-chop, like quick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Thlaskin and Maluleme have been crying in his
beer, too, as well as yours?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess so, but that wasn’t it. It’s next on the list, an
urgent—they’ve been screaming bloody murder for
months. So, with or without a brain, I’ve got to blast off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Start blasting as soon as you like, just as we are,” she
decided instantly. “Much more important, at this stage, to
work with you than to have Earth’s resources close by.
Besides, I think everything we’re apt to need is already
aboard—machine shop, electronics labs, materials, and
experts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“QX.” He gave orders. Then:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As for me, I’m going to hit the sack. I’m just about
pooped.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t wonder. That kind of stuff takes a lot of doing.
’Night, Storm.”</p>

<p class='noindent'>THE FOLLOWING MORNING, en route to the planet
of the pink humanoids, Cloud was studying a scratch-chart
of the First Galaxy. He had been working on the thing for
weeks; had placed several hundred crossed circles, each
representing a loose atomic vortex. He was scrawling
weird-looking symbols and drawing freehand connecting
lines when Joan came swishing into the “office.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good morning, Effendi of Esoterica!” she greeted him
gaily. “How’s the massive intellect? Firing on all forty
barrels, I hope and trust?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Missing on all forty is more like it. Ideas are avoiding
me in droves.” He looked her over amiably, in what he
hoped she would think was a casual way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He’d found himself doing quite a lot of that, lately .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
but she was <span class='it'>such</span> a swell egg! Why hadn’t she ever married?
What a waste <span class='it'>that</span> was! Face a bit on the strong side
for vapid calendar-girl prettiness, but.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But kind of attractive, at that, in her own gruesome
way, eh?” she finished the thought for him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Huh?” Cloud gulped, and, for the first time in years,
blushed scarlet; flushed to the tips of his ears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry, Storm, believe me. I don’t think I was
supposed to tell you—in fact, I know very well I wasn’t—but
I’ve simply got to. It isn’t fair not to; besides, I’ve
thought all along that Lensman Strong was wrong—that
we’d go faster and farther if you knew than if you didn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh—<span class='it'>that’s</span> what Phil was holding out on me back
there? I thought there was something fishy, but couldn’t
spot it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was sure you did. So was Phil. You told me what the
Tomingans call telepaths—snoopers? I <span class='it'>like</span> that word; it’s
so beautifully appropriate. Well, I’m snooping all the time.
Not only while we’re working, as you thought, but <span class='it'>all</span> the
time, especially when you’re relaxed and .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and off-guard,
so to speak. I’ve been doing it ever since I first met
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cloud blushed again. “So you knew exactly what I was
thinking just then? You gave me a remarkably poor play-back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The portrait was much too flattering. But we’ll skip
that. Part of my job is to make a telepath out of you, so
that you can show me with your mind—it can’t be done in
words or symbols—what it is that makes a mathematical
prodigy tick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How are you figuring on going about it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know—yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Phil tried, and so did a couple of Gray Lensmen, and I
wasn’t holding back a thing .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. oh, he emphasized that
you’re a <span class='it'>self-made</span> telepath. A different angle of approach?
How did you operate on yourself?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know that, either; but I hope to find out
through you. I read, and studied, and tried, and all of a
sudden—bang!—there it was. But words are useless; I’m
coming into your mind. Now watch me closely, concentrate:
<span class='it'>really</span> concentrate, as hard as you possibly can.
Ready? It goes like this .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. did you get it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. I couldn’t follow the details—it seemed like an
instantaneous transition. Didn’t you have more to begin
with than I’ve got?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think so .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. pretty sure I didn’t. I could
receive—I think it’s impossible for anyone to become a
telepath who can’t—but I couldn’t send a lick. My psi
rating was a flat zero zero zero. Now try it again. Take a
good, solid grip on a thought and <span class='it'>throw</span> it at me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“QX. I’ll try.” Cloud’s forehead furrowed, his muscles
tensed in effort. “Since you already know I’ve been wondering
why you never married—why? Standards too
high?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You might call it that.” It was the woman’s turn to
blush, but her thought was clear and steady. Cloud was
working with her better than he had ever worked with
either Luda or Nadine. “Since the days of my teen-age
crushes on tri-di idols I simply haven’t been able to develop
any interest in a man who didn’t have as much of a
brain as I have, and the only such I met were either
already married or didn’t have anything <span class='it'>except</span> a brain—which
wouldn’t do, either, of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course not.” Cloud felt something stirring inside
him that he thought completely dead, and tried, in near-panic
fashion, to kill it again. He changed the subject
abruptly. “No luck—I’m not getting through to you at all.
We’d better start all over, at the bottom. What’s the first
thing I’ve got to do to learn to be a snooper?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must learn how to concentrate—intensively and in
a very special way. You’re very good at ordinary concentration—especially
mathematical stuff—now; but this kind
is different—so much so as to be a difference in kind, not
merely of degree.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Check. Point one, a new kind of concentration. Next?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No next. That’s all. When you get so you can concentrate
correctly—I’ll coach you mind to mind on that, of
course—we’ll concentrate together, first on one gateway,
then another. Something will click into place, and there
you’ll be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope. But suppose it doesn’t? Can’t it be worked out?
You’re on record as saying that the mind is simply a
machine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, it can’t. The mind <span class='it'>is</span> a machine; just as much a
machine as one of your automatic pilots or one of my
computers. The troubles are that it is almost infinitely
more complex and that we do not understand its basic
principles—the fundamental laws upon which it operates.
We may <span class='it'>never</span> understand them .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the mind may very
well be so tied in with the life-principle—or soul; call it
whatever you please—as to be knowable only to God.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad you said that, Joan. I’m not formally religious,
I suppose, but I do believe in a First Cause.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One must, who knows as much about the Macrocosmic
All as you do. But it’s too early in the morning for very
much of that sort of thing. What are you doing to that
chart besides doodling all over it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Those aren’t doodles, woman!” he protested. “They’re
equations. In shorthand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Equations, I apologize. Doctor Cloud, elucidate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doctor Janowick, I can’t. This is where you came in. I
had just pursued an elusive wisp of thought into what
turned out to be a cul de sac. I whammed my head
against a solid concrete wall.” His light mood vanished as
he went on:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In spite of what everybody has always believed, I’ve
<span class='it'>proved</span> that loose atomic vortices are not accidental.
They’re deliberate, every one of them, and.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I heard you tell Phil so,” she interrupted. “I
wanted to start screaming about your hypothesis then, and
it’s taken superhuman self-control to keep me from
screaming about it ever since. That kind of math, though,
of course is ’way over my head.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. For a long time I expected
Phil to call up and blast you to a cinder, but he
didn’t .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you may be—<span class='it'>must</span> be, I suppose—right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am right,” Cloud said, quietly. “Unless all the mathematics
I know is basically, fundamentally fallacious,
they’ve <span class='it'>got</span> to be deliberate; they simply <span class='it'>can’t</span> be accidental.
On the other hand, except for a few we know about
which don’t change the general picture in the least, I can’t
see any more than you can how they can possibly be
deliberate, either.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you trying to set up a paradox?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. It’s already set up. I’m trying to knock it down.”
Cloud’s thought died away; his mind became a mathematical
wilderness of such complexity that the woman, able
mathematician that she was and scan as she would, was
lost in seconds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He finally shrugged himself out of it. “Another blind
alley,” he reported, sourly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With sufficient knowledge, any possible so-called paradox
can be resolved,” Joan mused, her mind harking back
to the, to her, starkly unbelievable hypothesis Cloud had
stated so baldly. “But I simply <span class='it'>can’t</span> believe it, Storm!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t, either, hardly. However, it’s easier for me to
believe that than that all our basics are false. So that
makes it another part of our job to find out what, or who,
or why.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ouch! With a job of that magnitude on your mind, I’ll
make myself scarce. When you come up for air sometime
give me a call on the squawk-box and we’ll study concentration.
’Bye.” She turned, started for the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait a minute, Joan—why not start the ground-work
now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a thought—why not? But get away from that
big table.” She placed two chairs and they sat down knee
to knee; almost eye to eye. “Now, Storm, come in. <span class='it'>Really</span>
come in, this time; the first time you didn’t really even
half try.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did so!” he protested. “I tried then and I’m trying
now. Just <span class='it'>how</span> do I go about it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t tell you that, Storm; <span class='it'>nobody</span> can tell you that.”
She was thinking now, not talking. “There are no words,
no symbology, even in the provinces of thought. And I
can’t do it for you: you <span class='it'>must</span> do it yourself. But if you
can’t—and you really can’t be expected to, so soon—I’ll
come into your mind and try to <span class='it'>show</span> you what I mean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did so. There was a moment of fitting; of snuggling
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. there was a warmly intimate contact, much warmer
and much more intimate than anything telepathic that
either had ever experienced before; but it was not what
they were after. Joan tried a different approach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if that won’t work, let’s try this. Just imagine,
Storm, that every cell of my brain—no, let’s keep it on
the immaterial level; every individual ultimate element of
my mind—is a lock, but you can see exactly what the key
must be like. You must make every corresponding unit of
your mind into the appropriate key.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. No? We’ll try
again. Imagine that each element of my mind is half of a
jigsaw puzzle—make yours fill out each picture.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t. Don’t you know, Joan, how many thousands of
millions of.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What of it?” she flared. “You do things fully as complex
every time you blast a vortex.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Oh, that’s it! Treat
it as though it were a problem in n-dimensional differential
equations, but don’t let your subconscious do it alone—get
right down there and work with it—do that and you’ll
have it all!” She seized his hands, squeezed them hard, and
spoke aloud, the better to drive home the intensity of her
convictions. “Buckle down, Storm, and dig .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you can do
it, I know you can do it. I <span class='it'>know</span> you can .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. dig in, big
fellow .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you don’t have to pay <span class='it'>too</span> much attention to
detail; get a chain started, like a zipper, and it’ll finish
itself .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. dig, Storm, DIG!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Storm dug. His jaw-muscles tightened into lumps. Sweat
beaded his face and trickled down his chest under his
shirt. And suddenly something happened. Not very much
of anything, but something. Something more than mere
contact, but not a penetration—more like a fusion—a
fusion which, however instead of spreading rapidly to
completion, as Joan had said it would, existed for the
merest perceptible instant of time in an almost infinitesimal
area and then vanished as instantaneously as it had
come. But there was no doubt whatever that he had read,
for an instant, a tiny portion of Joan’s mind; there was no
chance whatever that she had sent him <span class='it'>that</span> thought—in
fact, she had been thinking at herself, not at him. And as
he perceived the tenor of that thought he let go all his
mental holds; tried frantically to bury the stolen thought
so deeply that Joan would never, <span class='it'>never</span> find out what it
had been.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No, not bury it, either. Flesh, rock, metal—any material
substance was perfectly transparent to thought. What
wasn’t? A thought-screen. He didn’t have one, of course,
but he knew the formula, and if he thought about that
formula hard enough it might create interference enough.
The catch would be whether he could talk at the same
time .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he probably could, if the subject matter didn’t
require concentration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joan, of course, knew instantly when Cloud pulled his
mind away from hers; and, not waiting to ask why in
words, drove in a probe to find out. Much to her surprise,
however, her beam of mental force was stopped cold; she
could not touch Cloud’s mind at all!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A block!” she exclaimed unbelievingly. “A real dilly,
too—as hard and tight as a D7M29Z screen! What did
you do, anyway, Storm, and how? I didn’t feel you get
in!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not reply immediately. He was too busy; for,
besides holding the screen-thought, he was also analyzing
and studying the thought he had stolen from Joan: separating
it out and arranging it into meaningful English words.
It was amazing, how many words could be contained in
one flashing, fleeting burst of thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Joanie, my not-so-bright old friend,” she had been
thinking, “you’ve simply got to cut out this silly damn
foolishness and act your age. You <span class='it'>must not</span> fall in love
with him; there’d be nothing in it for either of you. You
are thirty-four years old and he has had his Jo.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Storm!” she snapped. “Answer me! Or did.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” Her
tone changed remarkably: “.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. did something .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. happen
to you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Joanie.” He shook his head and wrenched his
attention back to reality. “But first, is whatever I’m doing
really a mind-block, and is it really holding?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—to both—curse it! And ‘Joanie’, eh? You <span class='it'>did</span> get
in. How did it go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not so good. Barely a touch. It didn’t spread after we
got it started. Just one flash and it went out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hm .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. m .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. m. That’s funny.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Not the way it
worked with me at all. However, I don’t see that it makes
any difference whether you get it by drips and driblets or
all at once, just so you get the full ability eventually. What
was it you picked up the first time, Storm?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s one thing you’ll never know, if I have to hold
this block forever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh.” Joan blushed, vividly. “I know what it was, then,
I think. But don’t you see.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I don’t see,” Cloud interrupted. “All I see is that
it’s worse than being a Peeping Tom in a girls’ dormitory.
I don’t like it. I don’t like any part of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You wouldn’t, of course—at first. Nevertheless, Storm,
you and I have <span class='it'>got</span> to work together, whether either of us
likes what happens or not. So let’s get at it. Bring it out
and look at it—let’s see if it’s so bad, really. It was just
that I was afraid maybe I was going to fall in love with
you and get burned to a crisp around the edges, wasn’t
it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was part of it. You were wrong in two things,
though. No matter how much I loved Jo—and I really did
love her, you know.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know, Storm.” Her voice was very gentle. “Everybody
knows you did. Not only did—you still do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. So much so that I thought I’d never be able to
talk about her without going off the deep end. But I can,
now. I’m beginning to think that perhaps Phil Strong was
right. Perhaps a man can love twice in his life, in exactly
the same way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman caught her breath and started to say something,
then changed her mind. The man went on:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The second point in error is that a woman at age
thirty-four is not necessarily a doddering wreck with one
foot in the grave and the other on a banana peel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I’m <span class='it'>so</span> glad, Storm!” she breathed; then
changed mood with an almost audible snap. “There! It’s
done and your guard is down. It wasn’t too bad, was it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a bit.” Cloud was surprised at how easily the thing
had been ironed out. “You’re a prime number, Joanie—a
slick, smooth operator. As smooth as five feet and two
inches of tan velvet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Uh-uh. Not me, so much; it’s just that we’re a very
nicely-matched pair. But I think we’d better lay off a
while before trying it again, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Check. Let our minds—mine, anyway—get over the
jitters and collywobbles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mine, too, brother; and I’ve got a sort of feeling that
what that mind of yours is going to develop into, little by
little, is something slightly different from ordinary telepathy.
But in the meantime, you’d better get back to work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know whether I can work up much enthusiasm
for work right now or not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure you can, if you try. What were you doing to that
chart when I came in? What have you got there, anyway?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on over and I’ll show you.” They bent over the
work-table, heads almost touching. “The pink area is the
explored part of the First Galaxy. The marks represent all
the loose vortices I know of. I’ve been applying all the
criteria I can think of to give me some kind of a toe-hold,
but up to the present moment I’m completely baffled.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you tried chronology yet? Peeling ’em off in
layers—by centuries, say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not exactly, although I did run a correlation against
time. Mostly been studying ’em either singly or en masse
up to now. Might be worth a fling, though. Why? Got a
hunch?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. And no particular reason; just groping for more
detailed data. Before you can solve any problem, you
know, you must know exactly what the problem is—must
be able to state it clearly. You can’t do that yet, can
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know I can’t. I’ve got some colored pins here
somewhere .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. here they are. Read me the dates and I’ll
stick colors accordingly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They soon ran out of colors; then continued with numbered-head
thumb-tacks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The job finished, they stood back and examined the
results.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See anything, Joan?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see <span class='it'>something</span>, but before I mention it, give me a
quick briefing on what you know already.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cloud thought for a minute. “Well, the distribution in
space is not random, but there is no significant correlation
with location, age, size, power, load-factor, or actual number
of power plants. Nor with nature, condition, or age of
the civilization of any planet. Nor with anything else I’ve
been able to dream up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They aren’t random in time, either; but there again
there’s no correlation with the age of the power-plant
affected, the age-status of atomic power of any particular
planet, or any other thing except one—there is an extremely
high correlation—practically unity—with time itself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought so,” Joan nodded. “That was what I noticed.
The older, the fewer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exactly. But with your new classification, Joan, I think
I see something else.” Cloud’s mathematical-prodigy’s
mind pounced. “And <span class='it'>how</span>! Until very recently, Joan, the
data will plot exactly on the ideal-growth-of-population
curve.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, they breed, some way or other. Nice—that gives
us a.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You said that, woman, I didn’t. I stated a fact; if you
wish to extrapolate it, that’s your privilege—but it’s also
your responsibility.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Huh! Don’t go pedantic on me. Haven’t you got any
guesses?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Except for this recent jump, which we can probably
ascribe to Fairchild and explosives, nary a guess. I can’t
see any possible point of application.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Neither can I. But if that’s the only positive correlation
you can find, and it’s just about unity, it must mean
<span class='it'>something</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Check. It’s <span class='it'>got</span> to mean something. All we have to do
is find out what .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I think maybe I see something else.”
Bending over, he sighted across the chart from various
angles. “Too many pins. Let’s clear a belt through here.”
They did so. “Will you read ’em to me in order, beginning
with the oldest?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At your service, sir. Sol.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cloud stuck a pin in Sol.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Galien—Salvador—DuPont—Eastman—Mercator—Centralia—
Tressilia—Chickladoria—Crevenia—DeSilva—Wynor—Aldebaran.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hold it! Don’t want Aldebaran—can’t use it. Take a
look at this!” For this first time Cloud’s voice showed
excitement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked, and saw a gently curving line of pins running
three-quarters of the way across the chart. “Why—that’s a
smooth curve—looks as though it could be the arc of a
circle—clear across all explored space!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cloud’s mind pounced again. “It is a circle—pretty
close, that is, according to these rough figures. Will you
read me the exact coordinates—spatial—from the book?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did so, and through Cloud’s mind there raced the
appropriate equations of solid analytic geometry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even closer. Now let’s apply a final refinement. From
their proper motions we can put each star back to where
it was at the vortex date. It’ll take a little time, but it may
be worth it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was. Cloud’s mien was solemn as he announced his
final figures. “Those twelve suns all lay on the surface of a
sphere. Radius, 53,327 parsecs, with a probable error of
one point three zero parsecs—which, since the average
density of the stars along that line is about point zero four
five per cubic parsec, makes it as perfect a spherical surface
as it is physically possible for it to be. The center of
that sphere is almost exactly on the ecliptic; its coordinates
are: Theta, 225°—12′—31.2647″; distance, 107.2259.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good heavens! It’s <span class='it'>that</span> exact? And <span class='it'>that</span> far outside the
Rim? That spoils my original idea of radiation from a
center. But all of the twelve oldest vortices are on that
surface, and <span class='it'>none</span> of them are anywhere else!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So they are. Which gets us where, lady?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nowhere that I can see, with a stupendous velocity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You and me both. Another thing, why that particular
time-space relationship in the first twelve? I can accept
Tellus being first, because we had atomics first, but that
logic doesn’t follow through. Instead, the time order goes
from Sol through Galien and so on to Eastman—to the
very edge of unexplored territory along that arc—then,
jumping back to the other side of Sol, goes straight on to
the edge of Civilization in the opposite direction. Can you
play <span class='it'>that</span> on any one of your brains, from Alice to
Margie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see how.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t, either. That relationship certainly means something,
too, but I’m damned if I can make any sense out of
it. And what sense is there in a spherical surface that big?
And why so ungodly accurate? Alphacent, there, is less
than one parsec outside the surface, but it didn’t have a
blow-up for over seven hundred years. How come? Anybody
or anything capable of traveling that far could
certainly travel half a parsec farther if he wanted to. And
look at the time involved—over a thousand years! Assuming
some purpose, what could it be? Human
operations, or any other kind I know anything about,
simply are not geared up to that kind of scope, either in
space or in time. None of it makes any kind of sense.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you consider it purely fortuitous that this surface is
as truly spherical as the texture of the medium will permit?”
she asked, loftily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I don’t, and you know I don’t—and don’t
misquote me, woman! It’s too fantastically accurate to be
accidental. And that ties right in with the previous paradox—that
vortices can’t possibly be either accidental or
deliberate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From a semantic viewpoint, your phraseology is deplorable.
The term ‘paradox’ is inadmissible—meaningless. We
simply haven’t enough data. I simply <span class='it'>can’t</span> believe, Storm,
that those horrible things were set off on purpose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Deplorable phraseology or not, I’ve got enough data to
put the probability out beyond the nine-sigma point—the
same probability as that an automatic screw-machine running
six-thirty-two brass hex nuts would accidentally turn
out a thirty-six-inch jet-ring made of pure titanite, diamond-ground,
finished, and fitted. We’re getting nowhere
faster and faster—with an acceleration of about 12 G’s
instead of any simple velocity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He fell silent; remained silent so long that the woman
spoke. “Well .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what do you think we’d better do next?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All I can think of is to find out what’s out there at the
center of that sphere .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and then to see if we can find
any other leads in this mess on the chart. I’ll call Phil.”</p>

<p class='noindent'>THE CONNECTION was made and he brought Lensman
Strong up to date, concluding: “So will you please get
hold of Planetography with a crash priority on anything
they know about that point?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll do that, Storm. I’ll call you back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Since Lensmen are potent beings, the call came soon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s one sun there,” Strong reported, “but it doesn’t
amount to much. A red dwarf—it may or may not be a
single. Unexplored. Astronomical data only.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How close did I come to it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Allowing for proper motion, you speared it. Less than
two hundredths of a parsec off. And there’s nothing else
within twelve parsecs—stars are mighty thin out beyond
the Rim, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know. That nails it, Phil. They don’t know, of
course, whether it has any planets or not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I see what you mean .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. shall I get a special
on it for you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish you would. It’d be worth while, I think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So do I. I’ll call Haynes and ask him to rush a ship out
there to get us a fine-tooth on it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks, Phil.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And there was something else.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Oh yes, your friend
Fairchild. Narcotics wants him, badly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not surprised. Alive? That might take some doing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Or dead. No difference, as long as they have his head
for positive identification,” and at Cloud’s surprised expression
Strong went on: “They don’t want him planting
any more Trenconian broadleaf, is all, which he’ll keep on
doing as long as he’s alive and loose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see. Wish I’d known sooner; we probably could have
caught him on Tominga.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I doubt it. They’ve been checking back on him, and
he’s a very, <span class='it'>very</span> sharp operator. He makes long flits, fast
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in peculiar directions. But if you stumble across him
again, grab him or blast.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just a minute, chief. You mean to say the <span class='it'>Patrol</span> can’t
<span class='it'>find</span> him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just that. He’s in with a big, strong mob; probably
heads it. They’ve been looking for him ever since you
found out that he wasn’t killed on Deka.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I’m speechless. But Graves .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but Graves was
dead, of course .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. didn’t <span class='it'>anybody</span> know Fairchild’s personal
pattern?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s exactly it; nobody that they could get hold of
knows his <span class='it'>real</span> pattern at all. All we’ve got that we can
depend on are his retinals. That shows the kind of operator
he is. So if you get a chance, blast him, but leave at
least one eye whole and bring it in, in deep-freeze. Nothing
else at the moment, is there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not that I know of. Clear ether, Phil!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Clear ether, Storm!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The plate went black and Cloud turned soberly to Joan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, that clears Fairchild up, but doesn’t help with the
real mystery. So, unless we can dig some more dope out
of this stuff on the chart, we can’t do much until we get
that finetooth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joan left the room, and Cloud, after racking his brain for
an hour, got up, shook himself, and went down the corridor
to his “private” office—which had long since ceased
to be private, as far as his friends were concerned—where
he found Vesta and Thlaskin talking busily in spaceal. Or,
rather, the Vegian was talking; the pilot was listening
attentively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. think <span class='it'>I’m</span> built, you ought to’ve seen <span class='it'>this</span> tomato,”
Vesta was narrating blithely. “What I mean, she’s a <span class='it'>dish</span>!”
She went into a wrigglesome rhythm which, starting at the
neck, flowed smoothly down her splendidly-modeled body
to the ankles. “<span class='it'>Stacked?</span> She’s stacked like Gilroy’s Tower,
Buster—an honest-to-god DISH, believe me, and raring to
go. We were on one of those long-week-end jaunts around
the system—you know, one of those deals where things
are pretty apt to get just a hair off the green at times.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But hey!” Thlaskin protested. “You said yourself a
while back you wasn’t old enough for that kind of monkey-business!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I wasn’t,” Vesta agreed, candidly enough. “I still
ain’t. I just went along for the ride.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And your folks <span class='it'>let</span> you?” Thlaskin was shocked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Natch.” Vesta was surprised. “Why not? If a tomato
don’t learn the facts of life while she’s young how’s she
going to decide what’s good for her when she grows up?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With or without a license, I got to butt into this,”
Cloud announced, also in spaceal; seating himself on a
couch and crossing his legs. He, too, was shocked; but he
was also intensely curious. “Did you decide, Vesta?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before the girl could answer, however, Joan Janowick
came strolling in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is this a private brawl, or can anybody get in on it?”
she asked, gaily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I invited myself in, so I’ll invite you, too. Come in and
sit down.” He made room for her beside him and went on
in English, speaking for her ear alone: “Just as well you
don’t know spaceal. This story Vesta is telling would curl
your hair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wake up, Junior.” Joan did not speak, but poured the
thought directly into his mind. “D’you think that cat-girl—that
<span class='it'>kitten</span>—can block <span class='it'>me</span> out of her mind?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oick! What a whiff! ’Scuse, please; my brain was out
to lunch. But you’ll get an earful, sister Janowick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’ll be interesting in a way you haven’t thought of,
too,” Joan went on. “Vegians are essentially feline, you
know, and cats as a race are both fastidious and promiscuous.
Thus, conflict. Is that what this is about?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Could be—I haven’t tried to read her.” Then, aloud:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go ahead, Vesta. Did the experience help you decide?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes. I’m too finicky to be a very good mixer.
There’s just too damn many people I simply can’t stand
the smell of.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s that <span class='it'>smell</span> thing again,” Thlaskin said. “You’ve
harped on it before. You mean to say you people’s noses
are <span class='it'>that</span> sensitive?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Absolutely. No two people smell alike, you know.
Some smell nice and some just plain stink. F’rinstance, the
boss here smells just wonderful—I could hug him all day
and love it. Doctor Janowick, too, she smells almost like
the skipper. You’re nice, too, Thlaskin, and so is Maluleme,
and Nadine. And Tommie ain’t bad; but a lot of the
others are just too srizonified much for my stomach.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see,” Cloud said. “You <span class='it'>do</span> give some people a lot of
room around here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yeah, and that’s what got this chick I was telling
Thlaskin here about in such a jam. She’s been bending her
elbow pretty free, and taking a jab or so of this and that
between drinks. But she ain’t sozzled, y’understand, not by
many a far piece; just lit up like Nyok spaceport. She’s
maybe been a bit on the friendly side with a few of her
friends, so this big bruiser—not a Vegian; no tail, even; an
Aldebaranian or some-such-like and a Class A-Triple-Prime
stinker—gets interested in a big way. Well, he
smells just like a Tellurian skunk, so she brushes him off,
kind of private-like, a few times, but it don’t take, so she
finally has to give him the old heave-ho right out in front
of everybody.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You slimy stinker, I’ve told you a dozen times it’s no
dice—you stink!’ she says, loud, clear, and plain. ‘This ship
ain’t big enough to let me get far enough away from you
to hold my breakfast down,’ she says, and this burns the
ape plenty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Lookit here, babe,’ he says, coming to a boil, ‘Bend
an ear while I tell <span class='it'>you</span> something. No klevous Vegian
chippie is going to play high and mighty with me, see? I’m
fed up to the gozzle. So come down off your high horse
right now, or I’ll.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You’ll what?’ she snarls, and puts a hand behind her
back. She’s seeing red now, and fit to be tied. ‘Make just
one pass at me, you kedonolating slime-lizard,’ she says,
‘and I’ll bust your pfztikated skull wide open!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He goes for her then, but, being a Vegian, her footwork’s
a lot better than his. She ducks, sidesteps, pulls her
sap, and lets him have it, but good, right behind the ear. It
takes the ship’s croaker an hour to bring him to, and the
skipper’s so scared he blasts right back to Vegia and the
croaker calls the hospital and tells ’em to have a meat-wagon
standing by when we sit down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A very interesting and touching tale, Vesta,” Cloud
said then, in English, “but pretty rough language for a
perfect lady, don’t you think?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How the hell else.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” Vesta started to reply in spaceal,
then switched effortlessly to English: “How else can a
lady, however ladylike she may be, talk in a language
which, except for its highly technical aspects, is basically
and completely profane, obscene, vulgar, lewd, coarse,
and foul? Not that that bothers me, of course.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor did it, as Cloud well knew. When a Master of
Languages studied a language he took it as a whole, no
matter what that whole might be. Every nuance, every
idiom, every possibility was mastered; and he used the
language <span class='it'>as it was ordinarily used</span>, without prejudice or
favor or motional bias.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but it’s so pitifully <span class='it'>inadequate</span>—there’s so much
that’s completely missing! Thlaskin objected before,
remember, that there wasn’t any word in spaceal he could
use—<span class='it'>would</span> use, I mean—to describe Maluleme as his
wife. And my brother—Zambkptkn—I’ve mentioned
him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Once or twice,” Cloud said, dryly. This was the understatement
of the trip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s a police officer. Not exactly like one of your
Commissioners of Police, or Detective Inspector, but
something like both. And in spaceal I can call him only
one of four things, the English equivalents of which are
‘cop,’ ‘lawman,’ ‘flatfoot,’ and ‘bull.’ <span class='it'>What</span> a language! But
I started to tell his story in spaceal and I’m going to finish
it in spaceal. It’ll be fun, in a way, to see how close I can
come to saying what I want to say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, switching back to the lingua franca of deep
space;</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So that’s how come my brother got into the act. The
hospital called the cops, of course, so he was there with
the meat-wagon and climbed aboard. He was all set to
pinch the jane and throw her in the can, but when he got
the whole story, and especially when she says she’s
changed her mind about circulating around so much—it
ain’t worth it, she says, she’d rather be an out-and-out
hermit than have to have even one more fight with anybody
who smelled like that—of course he let her go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let her <span class='it'>go</span>!” Cloud exclaimed. “How <span class='it'>could</span> he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, sure, boss.” Vesta, wide-eyed, gazed innocently
at her captain. “The ape didn’t <span class='it'>die</span>, you know, and she
wasn’t going to do it again, and he wasn’t a Vegian, so
didn’t have any relatives or friends to go to the mat for
him, and besides, anybody with one-tenth of one percent
of a brain would know better than to keep on making
passes at a frail after she warned him how bad he stunk.
What <span class='it'>else</span> could he do, chief?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What else, indeed?” Cloud said, in English. “I live;
and—occasionally—I learn. Come on, Joan, let’s go and
devote the imponderable force of our massed intellects to
the multifarious problems of loose atomic vortices.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the way, Joan asked: “Our little Vesta surprised
you, Storm?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Didn’t she you? She had me gasping like a fish.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not so much. I know them pretty well and I used to
breed cats. Scent: hearing—they can hear forty thousand
cycles: the fact that they mature both mentally and physically
long before they do sexually: some of their utterly
barbarous customs: it’s quite a shock to learn how—‘queer,’
shall I say?—some of the Vegian mores are to us
of other worlds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Queer’ is certainly the word—as queer as a nine-credit
bill. But confound it, Joan, I <span class='it'>like</span> ’em!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So do I, Storm,” she replied quietly. “They <span class='it'>aren’t</span>
human, you know, and by Galactic standards they qualify.
And now we’ll go and whack those vortices right on their
center of impact.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll do that, chum,” he said. Then, in perfect silence
he went on in thought: “Chum? Sweetheart, I meant.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
My God, <span class='it'>what</span> a sweetheart you’d.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Storm!” Joan half-shrieked, eyes wide in astonishment.
“You’re <span class='it'>sending</span>!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not either!” he declared, blushing furiously. “I
can’t—you’re <span class='it'>snooping</span>!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not snooping—I haven’t snooped a lick since I
started talking. You <span class='it'>got</span> it back there, Storm!” She seized
both his hands and squeezed. “You <span class='it'>did</span> it, and neither of
us realized it ’til just this minute!”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='123' id='Page_123'></span><h1 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>Chapter 13</span><br/> ▂▂▂▂▂▂<span style='font-size:larger'>GAMES WITHIN GAMES</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'>THE METHODS of operation of the <span class='it'>Vortex Blaster II</span>
had long since been worked out in detail. Approaching
any planet Captain Ross, through channels, would ask
permission of the various governments to fly in atmosphere,
permission to use high explosive, permission to
land and be serviced, and permission—after standard precautions—to
grant planetary leave to his ship’s personnel.
All this asking was not, of course, strictly necessary in his
case, since every world having even one loose atomic
vortex had been demanding long and insistently that Neal
Cloud visit it next, but it was strictly according to protocol.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Astrogators had long since plotted the course through
planetary atmosphere; not by the demands of the governments
concerned and not by any ascending or descending
order of violence of the vortices to be extinguished, but by
the simple criterion of minimum flight-time ending at the
pre-selected point of entry to the planet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus neither Joan nor Cloud had anything much to do
with planetary affairs until the chief pilot notified Joan
that he was relinquishing control to her—which never happened
until the vessel lay motionless with respect to the
planet’s surface and with the tip of her nose three two
zero zero point zero meters distant from the center of
activity of the vortex.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Approaching Chickladoria, the routine was followed
precisely up to the point where Joan’s mechanical brain
took over. This time, however, the brain was not working,
since Joan was in the throes of rebuilding “Lulu” into
“Margie.” On Chickladoria, then, the chief pilot did the
piloting and “Storm” Cloud did the blasting, and everything
ran like clockwork. The ship landed at Malthester
spaceport and everyone who could possibly be spared
disembarked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ready to leave the ship, Cloud went to the computer
room to make one last try. There, seated at desks, Joan
and her four top experts were each completely surrounded
by welters of reference books, pamphlets, wadded-up
scratch-paper, tapes, and punched cards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hi, Joan—Hi, fellows and gals—why don’t you break
down and come on out and get some fresh air?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sorry, Storm, but the answer is still ‘no’. We’ll need all
this week, and probably more.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” Joan looked up at him
and broke off. Her eyes widened and she whistled expressively.
“Myohmy, ain’t he the <span class='it'>handsomest</span> thing, though? I
wish I <span class='it'>could</span> go along, Storm, if only to see you lay ’em
out in rows!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For, since Chickladoria was a very warm planet—fully
as hot as Tominga had been—Cloud was dressed even
more lightly than he had been there; in sandals, breech-clout,
and DeLameter harness, the shoulder-strap of the
last-named bearing the three silver bars of a commander
of the Galactic Patrol. He was not muscled like a gladiator,
but his bearing was springily erect, his belly hard and
flat, his shoulders were wide, his hips were narrow, and his
skin was tanned to a smooth and even richness of brown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wellwell! Not bad, Storm; not bad at all.” One of the
men got up and looked him over carefully. “If I looked
like that, Joan, I’d play hookey for a couple of days
myself. But I wouldn’t dare to—in that kind of a get-up
I’d look like something that had crawled out from under a
rock and I’d get sunburned from here to there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s your own fault, Joe,” a tall, lissom, brunette
lieutenant chipped in. “You <span class='it'>could</span> have the radiants on
while you do your daily dozens, you know. Me, I’m
mighty glad that <span class='it'>some</span> of the men, and not only us
women, like to look nice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait a minute, Helen!” Cloud protested, blushing.
“That’s not it, and you know it. These fellows don’t <span class='it'>have</span>
to mix socially with people who run around naked, and I
do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And how you hate it.” The other man offered mock
sympathy, with a wide and cheerful grin. “<span class='it'>How</span> you
suffer—I don’t think. But that holster-harness. It looks
regulation enough, but isn’t there somehing a little different
about it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Two things.” Cloud grinned back. “Left-handed,
and the holster’s anchored so it can’t flop around. Don’t
know as I ever told you, but ever since that alleged pirate
burned my arm off I’ve been practising the gun-slick’s
draw.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you get it?” Joan asked impishly. “How good are
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not bad—in fact, I’m getting plenty good,” Cloud
admitted. “Come on up to the range sometime with a
stop-watch and I’ll show you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll do that. Right now—shall we?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Uh-uh. Can’t. I’m due at the High Mayor’s Reception
in twenty minutes, and besides, I want to breathe some air
that hasn’t been rehabilitated, rejuvenated, recirculated,
reprocessed, repurified, and rebreathed until it’s all worn
out. Happy landings, gang—I’ll be thinking of you while
I’m absorbing all that nice new oxygen and stuff.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Particularly the stuff—and especially the <span class='it'>liquid</span> stuff!”
Joe called after him just before he shut the door on his
way out to join Thlaskin and Maluleme.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Going through customs was of course the merest
formality, and an aircab whisked them into the city proper.
Cloud really did enjoy himself as he strode along the
walkway from the cabpark toward the Mayor’s .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well, if
not exactly a palace, it was close enough so as to make no
difference. And he did attract plenty of attention. Not
because of his dress or his build—most of the men on the
street wore less than he did and many of them were just
as trim and as fit—but because of the nature and variety
of his bodily colors, which were literally astounding to
these people, not one in twenty of whom had ever before
seen a Tellurian in person.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For Chickladorians are pink; pink all over. Teeth, hair,
skin, and nails; all pink. Not the pink of red blood
showing through translucency, but that of opaque pigment.
Most of their eyes, even—queerly triangular eyes
with three lids instead of two—are of that same brick-reddish
pink; although a few of the women have eyes of a
dark and dusky green.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This visitor’s skin, however, was of a color so monstrous
it simply had to be seen to be believed. In fact, it wasn’t
the same color in any two places—it VARIED! His teeth
were white; a horrible, dead-bone color. His lips, hair, and
eyes—funny, round, flat-opening things—were of still other
sheerly unbelievable colors—there wasn’t a <span class='it'>bit</span> of natural,
healthy pink about him anywhere!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus the crowds of Chickladorians studied him much
more intensively than he studied them; and Maluleme,
strutting along at his side, basked visibly in the limelight.
And thus, except for the two Chickladorians at his side
and except for the unobtrusive but efficient secret-service
men who kept the crowding throng in hand, Cloud could
very well have been mobbed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The walk was very short, and at its end:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How long we got to stay, boss?” Thlaskin asked, in
spaceal. “As soon as we can get away we want to join our
folks and grab a jet for home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As far as I’m concerned you don’t need to stay at all,
or even come. Why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just checking, is all. His Nibs sent us a special bid, so
we got to at least show up. But he don’t know us from
nothing, so after we tell him hello and dance a couple of
rounds and slurp a couple of slugs we can scram and
nobody’ll know it unless you spill.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No spill,” Cloud assured him. “You dance with Maluleme
first. I’ll take the second—that’ll drive it in that she’s
here. After that, flit as soon as you like. For the record,
you’ll be here until the last gilot is picked clean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks, boss,” and the three, entering the extravagantly-decorated
Grand Ballroom, were escorted ceremoniously
up to the Presence and the Notables and their surrounding
V. I. P.’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were welcomed effusively, Cloud being informed
through several different interpreters that he was the
third-most-important human being who had ever lived. He
made—through two interpreters, each checking the other’s
accuracy—his usual deprecatory speech concerning the
extinguishment of loose atomic vortices. He led the Grand
March with the president’s wife, a lady whose name he
did not quite catch and who, except for a pound or so of
diamonds, rubies, emeralds, and other baubles, was just as
bare as Maluleme was. So was the equally heavily bejeweled
mayor’s wife, with whom he had the first dance. She
was neither young or slender, nor was she sexy. Then, as
agreed, he danced with Maluleme, who was—but definitely!—all
three.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, as he circled the floor in time with the really
excellent music, he thought, not of the attractive package
of femininity in his arms—who was one of his crew and
Thlaskin’s wife—but of Joan. She’d been training down,
he’d noticed, and wearing more makeup, since those other
girls had come aboard. She was getting to be a regular
seven-sector callout—he’d <span class='it'>like</span> to dance with Joan this
way!</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were other dances; some with girls like Maluleme,
some with women like Madam Mayor, most with
in-betweens. There was food, which he enjoyed thoroughly.
There were drinks; which, except for ceremonial beakers
of fayalin with the president and the mayor, he did not
touch. And, finally, there was the very comfortable bed in
his special suite at the hotel. Instead of sleep, however,
there came a thing he expected least of any—a sharp,
carefully-narrowed Lensed thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is Tivor Nordquist of Tellus, Commander Cloud,
on my Lens,” the thought flowed smoothly in. “I have
waited until now so as not to startle you, not to make you
show any sign of anything unusual going on. There must be
no suspicion whatever that you even know there’s a Lensman
on the planet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can take care of my part of that. One thing, though;
I’ve got exactly one week to work with you. One week
from today any possible excuse for me staying on Chickladoria
goes p-f-f-t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know. One day should button it up, two at most.
Here’s the print. I’m a narcotics man, really but.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh—Fairchild, eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Ellington told me you’re quick on the uptake.
Well, all leads to him via any drug channels fizzled out
flat. So, since all these zwilnik mobs handle all kinds of
corruption—racketeering, gambling, vice, and so on, as
well as drugs—we decided to take the next-best line,
which turned out to be gambling. After a lot of slow
digging we found out that Fairchild’s gang controls at
least four planets; Tominga, Vegia, Chickladoria, and Palmer
III.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What? Why, those planets cover.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Check. That’s what made the digging so tough, and
that’s why they did it that way. And you’re scheduled for
Vegia next, is why I’m meeting you here. But to get back
to the story, we haven’t got dope enough to find Fairchild
himself except by pure luck. So we decided to make
Fairchild’s mob tell us where he is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’ll be a slick trick if we can do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here’s how. <span class='it'>Somebody</span> on this planet knows how to
call Fairchild in emergencies, so we’ll create an emergency
and he’ll do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My mind is open, but I’m a bit skeptical. What kind of
an emergency have you got in mind?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some of the details you’ll have to ad lib as you go
along, but it’ll be, basically, bold-faced robbery without a
blaster and with them jittery as glaidos because they can’t
figure it. I was going to try to do it myself, but I can’t work
without my Lens and I can’t come near the hot spots
without their spy-rays catching the Lens and blowing the
whole show. Doctor Janowick told Phil Strong that she
could, without using her sense of perception and after only
a short practise run, beat any crooked card game any
gambler could dream up—something about random and
nonrandom numbers. Can she?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Um-m .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. never thought of it .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <span class='it'>random</span> numbers
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Oh, I see. Yes, she can. Especially the most-played
one, that over-and-under-seven thing. And with a little
telepathy thrown in, I can do the same with any crooked
game they’ve got except a magnetically-controlled wheel;
and I could do a fair job on that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better and better. You and Miss Janowick, then; and
be sure and bring Vesta the Vegian along.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Vesta? Um .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Maybe, at that. Adolescent Vegians
not only can be, but are, interested in everything that goes
on, everywhere. They’re born gamblers, and she’s already
got a reputation for throwing money around regardless—and
she’s rich enough to afford it. And in a winning streak
she’ll stir up so much excitement that nobody will pay any
attention to anybody else. However, things being what
they are, I’ll have to be mighty careful about letting her go
on a gambling spree.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not too much so. Just hint that you won’t fire her if
she takes a fling or two at the tables and she’ll be so
happy about it and love you so much that she won’t even
think of wondering why.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so it proved. After a long discussion of details with
the Lensman, Cloud went to sleep. The following afternoon
he went back to the ship and sought out Vesta,
whom he found slinking dejectedly about with her tail
almost dragging on the floor. Scarcely had he begun his
suggestion, however, when:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Really</span>, chief?” Vesta’s tail snapped aloft, her pointed
ears quivered with eagerness. She hugged him ecstatically,
burying her face in the curve of his neck and inhaling
deeply. “You zmell <span class='it'>zo</span> wonderful, chief—but a wonderful
man like you would <span class='it'>have</span> to smell zo, wouldn’t he? I
thought you’d smack me bow-legged if I even hinted at
wanting to lay a ten-cento chip on the line. But I <span class='it'>know</span> I
can beat the games they’ve got on <span class='it'>this</span> planet .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and
besides, I’ve been gone half a year and haven’t spent a
hundred credits and I’ve learned nine languages including
your cursed English.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She took out her book of Travelers’ Cheques and stared
at it thoughtfully. “Maybe, though, just to be on the safe
side, I’d better tear one of these out and hide it in my
room. It’d be <span class='it'>awful</span> to have to call my mother for jet fare
home from the ’port. She and dad both’d yowl to high
heaven—they’d claw me ragged.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Huh? But listen!” Cloud was puzzled. “If you shoot
such a terrific wad as that, what possible difference would
it make whether you had plane fare for a few hundred
miles left or not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, lots,” she assured him. “They don’t expect me to
have much of any of my allowance left when I get home,
and I never intended to, anyway. But <span class='it'>anybody</span> with half a
brain is expected to be able to get home from a party—<span class='it'>any</span>
kind of a party—without crying for help, and without
walking, either; so I’ll go hide one of these slips.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If <span class='it'>that’s</span> all that’s bothering you, no matter,” Cloud
said quickly. “You’ve got another pay day coming before
we get to Vegia, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I never thought of that—I’ve never been on a
payroll before, you know, and can’t get used to being paid
for doing nothing. But can we go now, Captain Nealcloud,
please? I can’t wait!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If Joan’s ready we can. We’ll go see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Joan was not ready. “Did you actually think she
would be?” Helen asked. “Don’t you know that the less a
woman puts on the longer it takes her to do it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nope—I s’posed Doctor Joan Janowick would be
above such frippery.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d be surprised. But say, how’d you talk her into
this vacation? Your manly charm, no doubt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Could be, but I doubt it. All she wanted was half an
excuse and the promise I wouldn’t get sore if we have to
kill a couple of days in space before starting shooting on
Vegia .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Hot Dog!—just <span class='it'>look</span> who’s here!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joan came in, pausing in embarrassment, at the burst of
applause and whistles that greeted her. She was richly,
deeply tanned; taut, trim, and dainty—she had trained
down to a hundred and fifteen pounds—her bra was a
triumph of the couturier’s art. She, too, was armed; her
DeLameter harness sported the two-and-a-half silver bars
of a lieutenant commander.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ouch—I’m bedazzled!” Cloud covered his eyes ostentatiously,
then, gradually and equally ostentatiously recovering
his sight: “Very nice, Joanie—you’re a ver<span class='it'>ee</span> slick
chick. With a dusting of powdered sugar and a dab of
cream you’d make a right tasty snack. Just one thing—a
bit overdressed, don’t you think?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Overdressed!</span>” she exclaimed. “Listen, you—I’ve never
worn a bathing suit <span class='it'>half</span> as skimpy as this in my whole life,
and if you think I’m going to wear any <span class='it'>less</span> than this
you’re completely out of your mind!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it isn’t <span class='it'>me</span>!” Cloud protested. “Patrol Regs are
strict that way—when in Rome you’ve got to be a Roman
candle, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know, but I’m Roman candle enough right now—in
fact, I feel like a flaming skyrocket. Why, this thing I’ve
got on is scarcely more than a G-string!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“QX—we’ll let it pass—this time.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hey, you know something?” Joe interrupted him before
Joan did. “Vegia is a couple of degrees warmer than
this, and they don’t overdo the matter of clothes there,
either. I <span class='it'>am</span> going to start basking under the radiants. If I
get myself cooked to a nice, golden brown, Helen—like a
slice of medium-done toast—will you do Vegiaton with
me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a date, brother!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Joe and Helen shook hands to seal the agreement,
the two Patrol officers and Vesta strode out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They took a copter to the Club Elysian, the plushiest
and one of the biggest places on the planet. The resplendently
decorated—in an undressed way, of course—doorman
glanced at the DeLameters, but, knowing the side-arm to
be the one indispensable item of the Patrol uniform wherever
found, he greeted them cordially in impeccable Galactic
Spanish and passed them along.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The second floor, I presume, sir and mesdames?” The
host, a very good rule-of-thumb psychologist, classified
these visitors instantly and suggested the region where
both class and stakes were high. Also, and as promptly, he
decided to escort them personally. Two Patrol officers and
a Vegian—especially the Vegian—rated special attention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second floor was really a place. The pile of the rug
was over half an inch deep. The lighting was neither too
garish nor too dim. The tastefully-placed paintings and
tapestries adorning the walls were neither too large nor
too small, each for its place; and each was a masterpiece.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May we use Patrol currency, or would you rather we
took chips?” Cloud asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Either one, sir; just as you wish.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We Tellurians are all set, then, but Miss Vesta here
would like to cash a few Travelers’ Cheques.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly, Miss Vesta. I’ll be delighted to take care of
it for you. How do you wish the money, please?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll want a little small stuff to get the feel of the house
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. say a thousand in tens and twenties. The rest of it in
fifties and hundreds, please—mostly hundreds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vesta peeled off and thumb-printed ten two-thousand
credit cheques and the host, bowing gracefully, hurried
away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One thing, Vesta,” Cloud cautioned. “Don’t throw it
away too fast. Save some for next time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I always do, chief. This’ll last me the week, easily.
I run wild only when I’m in a winning streak.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The host came up with her money; and as Vesta made
a beeline for the nearest wheel:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you like, Joan?” Cloud asked. “A wheel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think so; not at first, anyway. I’ve had better
luck with the under-and-overs. They’re over there, aren’t
they, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, madame. But is there anything I can do first?
Refreshments of any kind—an appetizer, perhaps?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at the moment, thanks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you wish anything, at any time, just send a boy. I’ll
look you up from time to time, to be sure you lack
nothing. Thank you very much, sir and madame.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The host bowed himself away and the two officers
strolled over to the bank of “under-and-over” tables,
which were all filled. They stood at ease for a few minutes;
chatting idly, enjoying their cigarettes, gazing with
interest and appreciation around the huge, but wonderfully
beautiful room. There was no indication whatever that
either of the two Patrolmen was the least bit interested in
the fall of the cards, or that two of the keenest mathematical
minds in space knew exactly, before the man ahead of
them got tired of losing fifty-credit chips, the denomination
and the location of every card remaining in the rack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joan could, of course, have read either the cards, or the
dealer’s mind, or both; but she was not doing either—yet.
This was a game—on the side, so to speak—between her
and Storm. Nor was it at all unequal, for Cloud’s uncanny
ability to solve complex mathematical problems was of
very little assistance here. This was a matter of more-or-less
simple sequences; of series; of arrangements; and her
years of cybernetic training more than made up for his
advantage in speed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your pleasure, madame or sir? Or are you together?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re together, thanks. We’ll take the next, for an
M.” Cloud placed a one-thousand-credit note in the velvet-lined
box.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two thin stacks of cards lay on the table at the dealer’s
right; one pile face up, the other, face down. He took the
top card from the rack, turned it over, and added it to the
face-up stack. “The ten of clubs,” he droned, sliding a
one-thousand-credit bill across the table to Cloud. “What
is your pleasure, sir and madame?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let it ride. Two M’s in the box,” Cloud said, tossing
the new bill on top of its mate. “Throw one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Discard one.” The dealer removed the next card and,
holding it so that neither he nor the players could see its
face, added it to the face-down pile. “What is your pleasure,
sir and madame?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Throw one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Discard one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll take this one,” and there were four thousand
credits in the box.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Throw one take one, and there were eight thousand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The eight became sixteen; then thirty-two; and the
dealer lost his urbanity completely. He looked just plain
ugly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe that’s enough for now,” Joan suggested. “After
all, we don’t want to take <span class='it'>all</span> the man’s money.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tightwad’s trick, huh? Quit while yer ahead?” the
dealer sneered. “Why’n’cha let ’er ride just once more?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you insist, we will,” Cloud said, “but I’m warning
you it’ll cost you thirty two more M’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what <span class='it'>you</span> think, Buster—I think different. Call
your play!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll take it!” Cloud snapped. “But listen, you clever-fingered
jerk—I know just as well as you do that the top
card is the king of clubs, and the one below it is the trey
of diamonds. So, if you want to stay healthy, move slowly
and be damned sure to lift just one card, not two, and
take it off the top and not the bottom!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Glaring in baffled fury, the dealer turned up the king of
clubs and paid his loss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the next table the results were pretty much the
same, and at the third. At the fourth table, however,
instead of pyramiding, they played only single M-bills.
They lost—won—lost—lost—won—lost—won—lost. In
twenty plays they were only two thousand credits ahead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think I’ve got it, Joan,” Cloud said then. “Coming
up—eight, six, jack, five, deuce?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Uh-uh. I don’t think so. Eight, six, jack, three, one, I
think. The trey of spades and the ace of hearts. A two-and-one
shift with each full cycle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Um .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. m. Could be .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but do you think the guy’s
that smart?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m pretty sure of it, Storm. He’s the best dealer they
have. He’s been dealing a long time. He knows cards.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if you’re done passing out compliments, how
about calling a play?” the dealer suggested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“QX. We’ll take the eight for one M .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and it <span class='it'>is</span> the
eight, you notice .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. let it ride .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. throw the six—without
looking, of course .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we’ll take the jack for two M’s.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The host, accompanied by no less a personage than the
manager himself, had come up. They stood quietly and
listened as Cloud took three bills out of the box, leaving
one, and went on:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The next card is either a five or a trey. That M there
is to find out which it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you sure of that?” the manager asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not absolutely, of course,” Cloud admitted. “There’s
one chance in approximately fourteen million that both
my partner and I are wrong.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very good odds. But since you lose in either case, why
bet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because if it’s a trey, she solved your system first. If
it’s a five, I beat her to it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see, but that isn’t necessary.” The manager took the
remaining cards out of the rack, and, holding them carefully
and firmly, wrapped the M-note tightly around them.
Then, picking up the two small stacks of played cards, he
handed the whole collection to Cloud, at the same time
signalling the dealer to go ahead with his game. “We’ll be
smothered in a crowd very shortly, and I would like very
much to play with you myself. Will you, sir and madame,
be gracious enough to continue play in private?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gladly, sir,” Joan assented, at Cloud’s questioning
glance. “If it would not put you out too much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am delighted,” and, beckoning to a hovering waiter,
he went on: “We will have refreshments, of course. In
uniform, you might possibly prefer soft drinks? We have
some very good Tellurian ginger ale.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’d be fine,” Cloud said, even while he was thinking
at the Lensman in contact with his mind: “Safe enough,
don’t you think? He couldn’t be thinking of any rough
stuff yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perfectly safe,” Nordquist agreed. “He’s just curious.
Besides, he’s in no shape to handle even the <span class='it'>Vortex
Blaster</span> alone, to say nothing of the task force he knows
would be here two hours after anything happened to
either of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The four strolled in friendly fashion to the suggested
private room. As soon as they were settled:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You said the top card would be either a five or a
trey,” the manager said. “Shall we look?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the trey of spades. “Congratulations, Joanie, a
mighty swell job. You really clobbered me on that one.”
He shook her hand vigorously, then handed the bill to the
manager. “Here’s your M-note, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I couldn’t think of it, sir. No tipping, you know.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know. Not a tip, but your winnings. I called the play,
remember. Hence, I insist.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well, if you insist. But don’t you want to look at
the next one?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. It’s the ace of hearts—can’t be anything else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To satisfy my own curiosity, then.” The manager
flipped the top card delicately. It was the ace of hearts.
“No compulsion, of course, but would you mind telling me
how you can <span class='it'>possibly</span> do what you have just done?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll be glad to,” and this was the simple truth. Cloud
had to explain, before the zwilniks began to suspect that
they were being taken by an organized force of Lensmen
and snoopers. “We aren’t even semi-habitual gamblers.
The lieutenant-commander is Doctor Joan Janowick, the
Patrol’s ace designer of big, high-speed electronic computers,
and I am Neal Cloud, a mathematical analyst.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are ‘Storm’ Cloud, the Vortex Blaster,” the manager
corrected him. “A super-computer yourself. I begin
to see, I think .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but go ahead, please.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You undoubtedly know that random numbers, which
underlie all games of chance, must be just that—purely
random, with nothing whatever of system or of orderliness
in their distribution. Also that a stacked deck, by definition,
is most decidedly <span class='it'>not</span> random. We were kicking that
idea around, one day, and decided to study stacked decks,
to see how systematic such distributions actually were.
Well—here’s the new part—we learned that any dealer
who stacks a deck of cards does so in some definite
pattern; and that pattern, whether conscious or unconscious,
is always characteristic of that one individual. The
more skilled the dealer, the more complex, precise, complete,
and definite the pattern. Any pattern, however complex,
can be solved; and, once solved, the cards might just
as well be lying face up and all in sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the other hand, while it is virtually impossible for
any dealer to shuffle a deck into a really random condition,
it can approach randomness so nearly that the patterns
are short and hence very difficult to solve. Also,
there are no likenesses or similarities to help. Worst of all,
there is the house leverage—the sevens of hearts, diamonds,
and clubs, you know—of approximately five point
seven seven percent. So it is mathematically certain that
she and I would lose, not win, against any dealer who was
not stacking his decks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. am .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. surprised. I’m <span class='it'>amazed</span>,” the manager
said. He was, too; and so was the host. “Heretofore it has
always been the guest who loses by manipulation, not the
house.” It is noteworthy that neither the manager nor host
had at any time denied, even by implication, that their
games of “chance” were loaded. “Thanks, immensely, for
telling me.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. By the way, you haven’t done this very
often before have you?” the manager smiled ruefully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.” Cloud smiled back. “This is the first time. Why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought I would have heard of it if you had. This of
course changes my mind about wanting to deal to you
myself. In fact, I’ll go farther—any dealer you play with
here will be doing his level best to give you a completely
random distribution.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fair enough. But we proved our point, which was
what we were primarily interested in, anyway. What’ll we
do with the rest of the day, Joan—go back to the ship?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Uh-uh. This is the most comfortable place I’ve found
since we left Tellus, and if I don’t see the ship again for a
week it’ll be at least a week too soon. Why don’t you send
a boy out with enough money to get us a chess kit? We
can engage this room for the rest of the day and work on
our game.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No need for that—we have all such things here,” the
host said quickly. “I’ll send for them at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No no—no money, please,” the manager said. “I am
still in your debt, and as long as you will stay you are my
guests.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” he paused, then went on in a strangely altered
tone: “But chess .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and Janowick .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Joan Janowick, not
at all a common name .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. surely not Past Grand Master
Janowick? She—retired—would be a much older
woman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The same—I retired for lack of time, but I still play as
much as I can. I’m flattered that you have heard of me.”
Joan smiled as though she were making a new and charming
acquaintance. “And you? I’m sorry we didn’t introduce
ourselves earlier.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Permit me to introduce Host Althagar, assistant manager.
I am called Thlasoval.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I know of you, Master Thlasoval. I followed your
game with Rengodon of Centralia. Your knight-and-bishop
end game was a really beautiful thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you. <span class='it'>I</span> am <span class='it'>really</span> flattered that you have heard
of <span class='it'>me</span>. But Commander Cloud.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, you haven’t heard of him. Perhaps you never will,
but believe me, if he had time for tournament play he’d be
high on the Grand Masters list. So far on this cruise he’s
won one game, I’ve won one, and we’re on the eighty
fourth move of the third.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The paraphernalia arrived and the Tellurians set the
game up rapidly and unerringly, each knowing exactly
where each piece and pawn belonged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have each lost two pawns, one knight, and one
bishop—in eighty three moves?” Thlasoval marveled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right,” Cloud said. “We’re playing for blood. Across
this board friendship ceases; and, when dealing with such a
pure unadulterated tiger as she is, so does chivalry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I’m a tiger, I’d hate to say what <span class='it'>he</span> is.” Joan glanced
up with a grin. “Just study the board, Master Thlasoval,
and see for yourself who is doing what to whom. I’m just
barely holding him: he’s had me on the defensive for the
last forty moves. Attacking him is just like trying to beat
in the side of a battleship with your bare fist. Do you see
his strategy? Perhaps not, on such short notice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joan was very willing to talk chess at length, because
the fact that Fairchild’s Chickladorian manager was a
chess Master was an essential part of the Patrol’s plan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I can’t say that I do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You notice he’s concentrating everything he can bring
to bear on my left flank. Fifteen moves from now he’d’ve
been focused on my King’s Knight’s Third. Three moves
after that he was going to exchange his knight for my
queen and then mate in four. But, finding out what he was
up to, I’ve just derailed his train of operations and he has
to revise his whole campaign.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No wonder I didn’t see .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I’m simply not in your
class. But would you mind if I stay and look on?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll be glad to have you, but it won’t be fast. We’re
playing strict tournament rules and taking the full four
minutes for each move.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s quite all right. I really <span class='it'>enjoy</span> watching Grand
Masters at work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Master though he was, Thlasoval had no idea at all of
what a terrific game he watched. For Joan Janowick and
Neal Cloud were not playing it; they merely moved the
pieces. The game had been played long since. Based upon
the greatest games of the greatest masters of old, it had
been worked out, move by move, by chess masters working
with high-speed computers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, while Joan and Storm were really concentrating,
it was not upon chess.</p>

<p class='noindent'>JOAN WAS HANDLING the card games, Cloud the
wheels. The suggestion that it would be smart to run
honest games had been implanted in the zwilniks’ minds,
not because of the cards, but because of the wheels; for a
loaded, braked, and magnetized wheel is a very tough
device to beat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joan, then, would read a deck of cards, and a Lensman
or a Rigellian would watch her do it. Then the observing
telepath would, all imperceptibly, insert hunches into the
mind of a player. And what gambler has ever questioned
his hunches, especially when they pay off time after time
after time? Thus more and more players began to win
with greater or lesser regularity and the gambling fever—the
most contagious and infectious disorder known to
man—spread throughout the vast room like a conflagration
in a box-factory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Storm Cloud was handling the wheels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen, before the ball
enters Zone Green,” the croupiers intoned. “The screens
go up, no bets can be placed while the ball is in the
Green.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>If the wheels had not been rigged, Cloud could have
computed with ease the exact number upon which each
ball would come to rest. In such case the Patrol forces
would not, of course, have given Vesta the Vegian complete
or accurate information. With her temperament and
her bank-roll, she would have put the place out of business
in an hour; and such a single-handed killing was not at all
what the Patrol desired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the wheels, of course, were rigged. Cloud was being
informed, however, of every pertinent fact. He knew the
exact point at which the ball crossed the green borderline.
He knew its exact velocity. He knew precisely the
strengths of the magnetic fields and the permeabilities,
reluctances, and so on, of all the materials involved. He
knew just about how much braking force could be applied
without tipping off the players and transforming them
instantly into a blood-thirsty mob. And finally, he was
backed by Lensmen who could at need interfere with the
physical processes of the croupiers without any knowledge
on the part of the victims.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hence Cloud did well enough—and when a house is
paying thirty-five to one on odds that have been cut down
to eight or ten to one, it is very, <span class='it'>very</span> bad for the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vesta started playing conservatively enough. She went
from wheel to wheel, tail high in air and purring happily
to herself, slapping down ten-credit notes until she won.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>This</span> is the wheel I like!” she exclaimed, and went to
twenties. Still unperturbed, still gay, she watched nine of
them move away under the croupier’s rake. Then she won
again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then fifties. Then hundreds. She wasn’t gay now, nor
purring. She wasn’t exactly tense, yet, but she was warming
up. As the tenth C-note disappeared, a Chickladorian
beside her said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why don’t you play the colors, miss? Or combinations?
You don’t lose so much that way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, and you don’t win so much, either. When I’m
gambling I <span class='it'>gamble</span>, brother .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and wait just a minute .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”
the croupier paid her three M’s and an L.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. “See
what I mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The crowd was going not-so-slowly mad. Assistant
Manager Althagar did what he could. He ordered all
rigging and gimmicks off, and the house still lost. On
again, off again; and losses still skyrocketed. Then, hurrying
over to the door of a private room, he knocked
lightly, opened the door, and beckoned to Thlasoval.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All hell’s out for noon!” he whispered intensely as the
manager reached the doorway. “The crowd’s winning like
crazy—everybody’s winning! D’you s’pose it’s them damn
Patrolmen there crossing us up—and how in <span class='it'>hell</span> could it
be?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you tried cutting out the gimmicks?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. No difference.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It can’t be them, then. It couldn’t be anyway, for two
reasons. The kind of brains it takes to work that kind of
problems in your head can’t happen once in a hundred
million times, and you say everybody’s doing it. They <span class='it'>can’t</span>
be, dammit! Two, they’re Grand Masters playing chess.
You play chess yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know I do. I’m not a Master, but I’m pretty
good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good enough to tell by looking at ’em that they don’t
give a damn about what’s going on out there. Come on
in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll disturb ’em and they’ll be sore as hell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You <span class='it'>couldn’t</span> disturb these two, short of yelling in their
ear or joggling the board.” The two walked toward the
table. “See what I mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two players, forearms on table, were sitting rigidly
still, staring as though entranced at the board, neither
moving so much as an eye. As the two Chickladorians
watched, Cloud’s left forearm, pivoting on the elbow,
swung out and he moved his knight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. no!” Shocked out of silence, Thlasoval
muttered the words under his breath. “Your queen, man—your
queen!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But this opportunity, so evident to the observer, did not
seem at all attractive to the woman, who sat motionless
for minute after minute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But come on, boss, and look this mess over,” the
assistant urged. “You’re on plus time now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose so.” They turned away from the enigma.
“But <span class='it'>why</span> didn’t she take his queen? I couldn’t see a thing
to keep her from doing it. I would have.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So would I. However, almost all the pieces on that
board are vulnerable, some way or other. Probably
whichever one starts the shin-kicking will come out at the
little end of the horn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Could be, but it won’t be kicking shins. It’ll be slaughter—and
<span class='it'>how</span> I’d like to be there when the slaughter
starts! And I <span class='it'>still</span> don’t see why she didn’t grab that queen.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you can ask her, maybe, when they leave. But
right now you’d better forget chess and take a good, long
gander at what that Vegian hell-cat is doing. She’s wilder
than a Radelgian cateagle and hotter than a DeLameter.
She’s gone just completely nuts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tense, strained, taut as a violin-string in every visible
muscle, Vesta stood at a wheel; gripping the ledge of the
table so fiercely that enamel was flaking off the metal and
plastic under her stiff, sharp nails. Jaws hard set and eyes
almost invisible slits, she growled deep in her throat at
every bet she put down. And those bets were all alike—ten
thousand credits each—and she was still playing the
numbers straight. They watched her lose eighty thousand
credits; then watched her collect three hundred and fifty
thousand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thlasoval made the rounds, then; did everything he
could to impede the outward flow of cash, finding that
there wasn’t much of anything he could do. He beckoned
his assistant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is bad, Althagar, believe me,” he said. “And I
simply can’t figure any part of it .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. unless.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” His voice
died away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You said it. I can’t, either. Unless it’s them two
chess-players in there, and I’ll buy it that it ain’t, I haven’t
even got a guess .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. unless there could be some Lensmen
mixed up in it somewhere. They could do just about
anything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Lensmen?</span> Rocket-juice! There aren’t any—we spy-ray
everybody that comes in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Outside, maybe, peeking in. Or some other snoopers,
maybe, somewhere?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t see it. We’ve had Lensmen in here dozens of
times, for one reason or another, business and social both,
and they’ve always shot straight pool. Besides, all they’re
getting is money, and what in all eleven hells of Telemanchia
would the Patrol want of our <span class='it'>money</span>? If they wanted
us for anything they’d come and get us, but they wouldn’t
give a cockeyed tinker’s damn for our <span class='it'>money</span>. They’ve
already got all the money there is!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s so, too. Money .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. hm, money in gobs and
slathers.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Oh, you think .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the Mob? D’ya s’pose it’s
got so big for its britches it thinks it can take <span class='it'>us</span> on?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wouldn’t think they could be <span class='it'>that</span> silly. It’s a lot more
reasonable, though, than that the Patrol would be horsing
around this way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But how? Great Kalastho, <span class='it'>how</span>?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do I know? Snoopers, as you said—or perceivers,
or any other ringers they could ring in on us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nuts!” the assistant retorted. “Just who do you figure
as ringers? The Vegian isn’t a snooper, she’s just a gambling
fool. No Chickladorian was ever a snooper, or a
perceiver either, and these people are just about all regular
customers. And <span class='it'>everybody’s</span> winning. So just where
does that put you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Up the creek—I know. But dammit, there’s <span class='it'>got</span> to be
snoopery or some other funny stuff <span class='it'>somewhere</span> in this!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Uh-uh. Did you ever hear of a perceiver who could
read a deck or spot a gimmick from half a block away?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t any. But what
stops me is what can we <span class='it'>do</span> about it? If the Mob <span class='it'>is</span> forted
up in that hotel across the street or somewhere beside or
behind us .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. there isn’t a damn thing we can do. They’d
have more gunnies than we could send in, even if we knew
exactly where they were, and we can’t send a young army
barging around without anything but a flimsy suspicion to
go on—the lawmen would throw us in the clink in nothing
flat.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Besides, this Mob idea isn’t exactly solid, either.
How’d they get their cut from all these people? Especially
the Vegian?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Vegian, probably not; the rest, probably so. They
could have passed the word around that this is the big
day. Anybody’d split fifty-fifty on a cold sure thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Uh-uh. I won’t buy that, either. I’d’ve known about
it—somebody would have leaked. No matter how you
figure it, it doesn’t add up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only one thing we can do. Close down. While you’re
doing that I’ll go shoot in a Class A Double Prime Urgent
to top brass.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hence Vesta’s croupier soon announced to his clientele
that all betting was off, at least until the following day.
All guests would please leave the building as soon as
possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a couple of minutes Vesta simply could not take in
the import of the announcement. She was stunned. Then:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whee .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. yow .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ow .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. erow!” she yowled, at the
top of her not inconsiderable voice. “I’ve won .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I’ve
<span class='it'>won</span> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I’VE WON!” She quieted down a little, still
shell-shocked, then looked around and ran toward the
nearest familiar face, which was that of the assistant
manager. “Oh, senor Althagar, do you actually want me
to quit while I’m <span class='it'>ahead</span>? Why, I never <span class='it'>heard</span> of such a
thing—it certainly never happened to <span class='it'>me</span> before! And I’m
going to stop gambling <span class='it'>entirely</span>—I’ll <span class='it'>never</span> get such a
thrill as this again if I live a million years!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re <span class='it'>so</span> right, Miss Vesta—you never will.” Althagar
smiled—as though he had just eaten three lemons without
sugar, to be sure, but it was still a smile. “It’s not that we
<span class='it'>want</span> you to quit, but simply that we can’t pay any more
losses. Right now I am most powerfully psychic, so take
my advice, my dear, and stop.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going to—honestly, I am.” Vesta straightened out
the thick sheaf of bills she held in her right hand, noticing
that they were all ten-thousands. She dug around in her
bulging pouch; had to dig half-way to the bottom before
she could find anything smaller. With a startled gasp she
crammed the handful of bills in on top of the others and
managed, just barely, to close and lock the pouch. “Oh,
I’ve got to <span class='it'>fly</span>—I must find my boss and tell him all about
this!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you like an armed escort to your hotel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That won’t be necessary, thanks. I’m going to take a
copter direct to the ship.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not until the crowd was almost all gone that
either Thlasoval or Althagar even thought of the two
chess-players. Then one signalled the other and they went
together to the private room, into it, and up to the
chess-table. To the casual eye, neither player had moved.
The board, too, showed comparatively little change; at
least, the carnage anticipated by Thlasoval had not materialized.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Althagar coughed discreetly; then again, a little louder.
“Sir and madam, please.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” he began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I told you they’d be dead to the world,” Thlasoval
said; and, bending over, lifted one side of the board. Oh,
very gently, and not nearly enough to dislodge any one of
the pieces, but the tiny action produced disproportionately
large results. Both players started as though a bomb had
exploded beside them, and Joan uttered a half-stifled
scream. With visible efforts, they brought themselves down
from the heights to the there and the then. Cloud stretched
prodigiously; and Joan, emulating him, had to bring
one hand down to cover a jaw-cracking yawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Excuse me, Grand Master Janowick and Commander
Cloud, but the Club is being closed for repairs and we
must ask you to leave the building.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Closed?” Joan parroted, stupidly, and:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For repairs?” Cloud added, with equal brilliance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Closed. For repairs.” Thlasoval repeated, firmly. Then,
seeing that his guests were coming back to life quite
nicely, he offered Joan his arm and started for the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, Grand Master Janowick,” he said en route.
“May I ask why you refused the Commander’s queen?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He would have gained such an advantage in position as
to mate in twelve moves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. thanks.” He didn’t, at all, but he had to say
something. “I wonder .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. would it be possible for me to
find out how this game comes out?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, I suppose so.” Joan thought for a moment.
“Certainly. If you’ll give me your card I’ll send you a tape
of it after we finish.”<a id='r3'/><a href='#f3' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[3]</span></sup></a></p>

<hr class='tbk100'/>

<p class='pindent'>The two Patrolmen boarded a copter. Joan looked
subdued, almost forlorn. Cloud took her hand and
squeezed it gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t take it so hard, Joan,” he thought. He found it
remarkably easy to send to her now; in fact, telepathy was
easier and simpler and more natural than talking. “We
had it to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose so; but it was a dirty, slimy, stinking, <span class='it'>filthy</span>
trick, Storm. I’m ashamed .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I feel soiled.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know how you feel. I’m not so happy about the
thing, either. But when you think of thionite, and what
<span class='it'>that</span> stuff means.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s true, of course .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and they stole the money in
the first place.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Not that two wrongs, or even three or
four, make a right .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but it does <span class='it'>help</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She cheered up a little, but she was not yet her usual
self when they boarded the <span class='it'>Vortex Blaster II</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vesta met them just inside the lock. “Oh, chief, I
won—I won!” she shrieked, tail waving frantically in air.
“Where’d you go after the club closed? I looked all <span class='it'>over</span>
for you—do you know how much I won, Captain Nealcloud?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Haven’t any idea. How much?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One million seven hundred sixty two thousand eight
hundred and ten credits! Yow-wow-yow!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whew!” Cloud whistled in amazement. “And you’re
figuring on giving it all back to ’em tomorrow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I haven’t quite decided.” Vesta sobered instantly.
“What do <span class='it'>you</span> think, chief?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not being a gambler, I don’t have hunches very often,
but I’ve got one now. In fact, I know one thing for certain
damn sure. There isn’t one chance in seven thousand
million of anything like this ever happening to you again.
You’ll lose your shirt—that is, if you had a shirt to lose,”
he added hastily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know, I think you’re right? I thought so myself,
and you’re the second smart man to tell me the same
thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who was the first one?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That man at the club, Althagar, his name was. So, with
three hunches on the same play, I’d be a fool not to play
it that way. Besides, I’ll <span class='it'>never</span> get another wallop like that
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. my uncle’s been wanting me to be linguist in his bank,
and with a million and three-quarters of my own I could
buy half his bank and be a linguist and a cashier both.
Then I couldn’t <span class='it'>ever</span> gamble again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Huh? Why not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because Vegians, especially young Vegians, like me,
haven’t got any sense when it comes to gambling,” Vesta
explained, gravely. “They can’t tell the difference between
their own money and the bank’s. So everybody who
amounts to anything in a bank makes a no-gambling
declaration and if one ever slips the insurance company
boots him out on his ear and he takes a blaster and burns
his head off.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cloud flashed a thought at Joan. “Is this another of
your strictly Vegian customs?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not mine; I never heard of it before,” she flashed
back. “Very much in character, though, and it explains
why Vegian bankers are regarded as being very much the
upper crust.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. so I <span class='it'>am</span> going to buy half of that bank. Thanks,
chief, for helping me make up my mind. Good night, you
two lovely people; I’m going to bed. I’m just about
bushed.” Vesta, tail high and with a completely new dignity
in her bearing, strode away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me, too, Storm; on both counts,” Joan thought at
Cloud. “You ought to hit the hammock, too, instead of
working half the night yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe so, but I want to know how things came out,
and besides they may want some quick figuring done.
Good night, little chum.” His parting thought, while commonplace
enough in phraseology, was in fact sheer caress;
and Joan’s mind, warmly intimate, accepted it as such and
returned it in kind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cloud left the ship and rode a scooter across the field to
a very ordinary-looking freighter. In that vessel’s control
room, however, there were three Lensmen and five Rigellians,
all clustered around a tank-chart of a considerable
fraction of the First Galaxy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hi, Cloud!” Nordquist greeted him with a Lensed
thought and introduced him to the others. “All our thanks
for a really beautiful job of work. We’ll thank Miss
Janowick tomorrow, when she’ll have a better perspective.
Want to look?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I certainly do. Thanks.” Cloud joined the group at the
chart and Nordquist poured knowledge into his mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thlasoval, the boss of Chickladoria, had been under full
mental surveillance every minute of every day. The
scheme had worked perfectly. As the club closed, Thlasoval
had sent the expected message; not by ordinary communications
channels, of course, but via long-distance
beamer. It was beamed three ways; to Tominga, Vegia,
and Palmer III. That proved that Fairchild wasn’t on
Chickladoria; if he had been, Thlasoval would have used a
broadcaster, not a beamer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shows had been staged simultaneously on all four of
Fairchild’s planets, and only on Vegia had the planetary
manager’s message been broadcast. Fairchild was on
Vegia, and he wouldn’t leave it: a screen had been thrown
around the planet that a microbe couldn’t squirm through
and it wouldn’t be relaxed until Fairchild was caught.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Simultaneous shows?</span>” Cloud interrupted the flow of
information. “On four planets? He won’t connect the
<span class='it'>Vortex Blaster</span> with it, at all, then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We think he will,” the Lensman thought, narrowing
down. “We’re dealing with a <span class='it'>very</span> shrewd operator. We
hope he does, anyway, because a snooper put on you or
any one of your key people would be manna from heaven
for us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But how <span class='it'>could</span> he suspect us?” Cloud demanded. “We
couldn’t have been on four planets at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will have been on three of them, though; and I
can tell you now that routing was not exactly coincidence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and I wasn’t informed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. Top Brass didn’t want to disturb you too much,
especially since we hoped to catch him before things got
this far along. But you’re in it now, clear to the neck. You
and your people will be under surveillance every second,
from here on in, and you’ll be covered as no chief of state
was ever covered in all history.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few months later, Joan did send him the full game, which
white of course won. Thlasoval studied it in secret for over five
years; and then, deciding correctly that he never would be able to
understand its terrifically complex strategy, he destroyed the tape.
It is perhaps superfluous to all that this game was never published.

<p class='noindent'>THE TRIP FROM Chickladoria to Vegia, while fairly
long, was uneventful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joan spent her working hours, of course, at her regular
job of rebuilding the giant computer. Cloud spent his at
the galactic chart or in the control room staring into a
tank; classifying, analyzing, building up and knocking
down hypotheses and theories, wringing every possible
drop of knowledge from all the data he could collect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In their “spare” time, of which each had quite a great
deal, they worked together at their telepathy; to such good
purpose that, when so working, verbal communication
between them became rarer and rarer. And, alone or in a
crowd, within sight of each other or not, in any place or at
any time, asleep or awake, each had only to think at the
other and they were instantly in full mental rapport.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And oftener and oftener there came those instantaneously-fleeting
touches of something infinitely more than
mere telepathy; that fusion of minds which was so ultimately
intimate that neither of the two could have said
whether he longed for or dreaded its full coming the
more. In fact, for several days before reaching Vegia,
each knew that they could bring about that full fusion any
time they chose to do so; but both shied away from its
consummation, each as violently as the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus the trip did not seem nearly as long as it actually
was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first order of business on Vegia, of course, was the
extinguishment of its five loose atomic vortices—for which
reason this was to be pretty much a planetary holiday,
although that is of little concern here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the <span class='it'>Vortex Blaster II</span> began settling into position, the
two scientists took their places. Cloud was apparently his
usual self-controlled self, but Joan was white and strained—almost
shaking. He sent her a steadying thought, but her
block was up, solid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t take it so hard, Joanie,” he said, soberly. “Margie’ll
take ’em, I hope—but even if she doesn’t, there’s a
dozen things not tried yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s just the trouble—there <span class='it'>aren’t</span>! We put just about
everything we had into Lulu; Margie is only a few milliseconds
better. <span class='it'>Perhaps</span> there are a dozen things not tried
yet, but I haven’t the faintest, foggiest smidgeon of an
idea of what any of them could be. Margie is the last
word, Storm—the best analogue computer it is possible to
build with today’s knowledge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I haven’t been a lick of help. I wish I could be,
Joan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see how you can be.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Oh, excuse me, Storm,
I didn’t mean that half the way it sounds. Do you want to
check the circuitry? I’ll send for the prints.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I couldn’t even carry your water-bottle on that
part of the job. I’ve got just a sort of a dim, half-baked
idea that there’s a possibility that maybe I haven’t been
giving you and your brains a square deal. By studying the
graphs of the next three or four tests maybe I can find out
whether.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lieutenant-Commander Janowick, we are in position,”
a crisp voice came from the speaker. “You may take over
when ready, madam.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, sir.” Joan flipped a switch and Margie took
control of the ship and its armament—subject only to
Cloud’s overriding right to fire at will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just a minute, Storm,” Joan said then. “Unfinished
business. Whether what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whether there’s anything I can do—or fail to do—that
might help; but I’ve got to have a lot more data.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cloud turned to his chart, Joan to hers; and nothing
happened until Cloud blew out the vortex himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The same lack of something happened in the case of the
next vortex, and also the next. Then, as the instruments
began working in earnest on the fourth, Cloud reviewed in
his mind the figures of the three previous trials. On the
first vortex, a big toughie, Margie had been two hundred
fifty milliseconds short. On the second, a fairly small one,
she had come up to seventy-five. On Number Three,
middle-sized, the lag had been one twenty-five. That made
sense. Lag was proportional to activity and it was just too
bad for Margie. And just too <span class='it'>damn</span> bad for Joanie—the
poor kid was just about to blow her stack.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But wait a minute! What’s this? This number four’s a
little bit of a new one, about as small as they ever come.
Margie ought to be taking it, if she’s ever going to take
anything .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but she isn’t! She’s running damn near three
hundred mils behind! Why? Oh—amplitudes—frequencies
extreme instability.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Lag isn’t proportional <span class='it'>only</span> to activity,
then, but jointly to activity and to instability.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That gives us a chance—but what in all nine of Palain’s
purple <span class='it'>hells</span> is that machine <span class='it'>doing</span> with that data?</p>

<p class='pindent'>He started to climb out of his bucket seat to go around
to talk to Joan right then, but changed his mind at his first
move. Even if Margie <span class='it'>could</span> handle this little one it
wouldn’t be a real test, and it’d be a crying shame to give
Joan a success here and then kick her in the teeth with a
flat failure next time. No, the next one, the only one left
and Vegia’s worst, would be the one. If Margie could
handle <span class='it'>that</span>, she could snuff anything the galaxy had to
offer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hence Cloud extinguished this one, too, himself. The
<span class='it'>Vortex Blaster II</span> darted to its last Vegian objective and
lined itself up for business. Joan put Margie to work as
usual; but Storm, for the first time, did not take his own
place. Instead, he came around and stood behind Joan’s
chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How’re we doing, little chum?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rotten!” Joan’s block was still up; her voice was
choked with tears. “She’s come so close half a dozen times
today—why—<span class='it'>why</span> can’t I get that last fraction of a second?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe you can.” As though it were the most natural
thing in the world—which in fact it was—Cloud put his
left arm around her shoulders and exerted a gentle pressure.
“Bars down, chum—we can think a lot clearer than
we can talk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s better,” as her guard went down. “Your differential
’scope looks like it’s set at about one centimeter to
the second. Can you give it enough vertical gain to make
it about five?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Ten if you like, but the trace would keep jumping
the screen on the down-swings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wouldn’t care about that—closest approach is all I
want. Give it full gain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“QX, but why?” Joan demanded, as she made the requested
adjustment. “Did you find out something I can’t
dig deep enough in your mind to pry loose?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t know yet whether I did or not—I can tell you in
a couple of minutes,” and Cloud concentrated his full
attention upon the chart and its adjacent oscilloscope
screen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One pen of the chart was drawing a thin, wildly-wavering
red line. A few seconds behind it a second pen
was tracing the red line in black; tracing it so exactly that
not the tiniest touch of red was to be seen anywhere along
the black. And on the screen of the differential oscilloscope
the fine green saw-tooth wave-form of the electronic
trace, which gave continuously the instantaneous value of
the brain’s shortage in time, flickered insanely and apparently
reasonlessly up and down; occasionally falling clear
off the bottom of the screen. If that needle-pointed trace
should touch the zero line, however briefly, Margie the
Brain would act; but it was not coming within one full
centimeter of touching.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The feeling that these failures have been partly, or
even mostly, my fault is growing on me,” Cloud thought,
tightening his arm a little: and Joan, if anything, yielded
to the pressure instead of fighting away from it. “Maybe I
haven’t been waiting long enough to give your brains the
leeway they need. To check: I’ve been assuming all along
that they work in pretty much the same way I do; that
they handle all the data, out to the limit of validity of the
equations, but aren’t fast enough to work out a three-point-six-second
prediction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But if I’m reading those curves right Margie simply
isn’t working that way. She doesn’t seem to be extrapolating
<span class='it'>anything</span> more than three and a half seconds ahead—’way
short of the reliability limit—and sometimes a lot
less than that. She isn’t <span class='it'>accepting</span> data far enough ahead.
She acts as though she can gulp down just so much
information without choking on it—so much and no
more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exactly. An over-simplification, of course, since it isn’t
the kind of choking that giving her a bigger throat would
cure, but very well put.” Joan’s right hand crept across her
body, rested on Cloud’s wrist, and helped his squeeze,
while her face turned more directly toward the face so
close to hers. “That’s inherent in the design of all really
fast machines .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and we simply don’t know any way of
getting away from it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Why? What has that to do with
the case?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A lot—I hope. When I was working in a flitter I had
to wait up to half an hour sometimes, for the sigma curve
to stabilize enough so that the equations would hold valid
will give a longer valid prediction.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stabilize? How? I’ve never seen a sigma curve flatten
out. Or does ‘stabilize’ have a special meaning for you
vortex experts?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Could be. It’s what happens when a sigma becomes a
little more regular than usual, so that a simpler equation
will give a longer valid prediction.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see; and a difference in wave-form that would be
imperceptible to me might mean a lot to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right. It just occurred to me that a similar line of
reasoning may hold for this seemingly entirely different set
of conditions. The less unstable the curve, the less complicated
the equations and the smaller the volume of actual
data.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” Joan’s thought soared high. “So Margie may
work <span class='it'>yet</span>, if we wait a while?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Check. Browning can’t take the ship away from you,
can he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. Nobody can do anything until the job is done or I
punch that red ‘stop’ button there. D’you suppose she <span class='it'>can</span>
do it? Storm? How long can we wait?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Half an hour, I’d say. No, to settle the point definitely,
let’s wait until I can get a full ten-second prediction and
see what Margie’s doing about the situation then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wonderful! But in that case, it might be a good idea
for you to be looking at the chart, don’t you think?” she
asked, pointedly. His eyes, at the moment, were looking
directly into hers, from a distance of approximately twelve
inches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll look at it later, but right now I’m.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ship quivered under the terrific, the unmistakable
trip-hammer blow of propellant heptadetonite. Unobserved
by either of the two scientists most concerned, the sigma
curve had, momentarily, become a trifle less irregular. The
point of the saw-tooth wave had touched the zero line.
Margie had acted. The visiplate, from which the heavily-filtered
glare of the vortex had blazed so long, went
suddenly black.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>She did it</span>, Storm!” Joan’s thought was a mental shriek
of pure joy. “<span class='it'>She really worked!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whether, when the ship went free, Joan pulled Storm
down to her merely to anchor him, or for some other
reason; whether Cloud grabbed her merely in lieu of a
safety-line or not; which of the two was first to put arms
around the other; these are moot points impossible of
decision at this date. The fact is, however, that the two
scientists held a remarkably unscientific pose for a good
two minutes before Joan thought that she ought to object
a little, just on general principles. Even then, she did not
object with her mind; instead she put up her block and
used her voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, after all, Storm,” she began, only to be silenced as
beloved women have been silenced throughout the ages.
She cut her screen then, and her mind, tender and unafraid,
reached out to his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This might be the perfect time, dear, to merge our
minds? I’ve been scared to death of it all along, but no
more .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. let’s?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Uh-huh,” he demurred. “I’m <span class='it'>still</span> afraid of it. I’ve been
thinking about it a lot, and doing some drilling, and the
more I play with it the more scared I get. It’s dangerous.
It’s like playing with duodec. I’ve just about decided that
we’d better let it drop.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Afraid? For yourself, or for me? Don’t try to lie with
your mind, Storm; you can’t do it. You’re afraid only for
me, and you needn’t be. I’ve been thinking, too, and
digging deep, and I know I’m ready.” She looked up at
him then, her quick, bright, impish grin very much in
evidence. “Let’s go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“QX, Joanie, and thanks. I’ve been wanting this more
than I ever wanted anything before in my life. But not
holding hands, this time. Heart to heart and cheek to
cheek.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Check—the closer the better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They embraced, and again mind flowed into mind; this
time with no thought of withholding or reserve on either
side. Smoothly, effortlessly, the two essential beings
merged, each fitting its tiniest, remotest members into the
deepest, ordinarily most inaccessible recesses of the other;
fusing as quickly and as delicately and as thoroughly as
two drops of water coalescing into one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In that supremely intimate fusion, that ultimate union
of line and plane and cellule, each mind was revealed
completely to the other; a revealment which no outsider
should expect to share.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, after neither ever knew how long, they released
each other and each put up, automatically, a solid block.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know about you, Storm,” Joan said then, “but
I’ve had just about all I can take. I’m going to bed and
sleep for one solid week.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You and me both,” Storm agreed, ungrammatically,
but feelingly. “Good night, sweetheart .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and this had all
better be strictly hush-hush, don’t you think?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I <span class='it'>do</span> think,” she assured him. “Can’t you just imagine
the field-day the psychs would have, taking us apart?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In view of the above, it might be assumed that the
parting was immediate, positive, and undemonstrative; but
such was not exactly the case. But they did finally separate,
and each slept soundly and long.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And fairly early the next morning—before either of
them got up, at least—Cloud sent Joan a thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Awake, dear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Uh-huh. Just. ’Morning, Storm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve got some news for you, Joanie. My brain is firing
on ten times as many barrels as I ever thought it had, and
I don’t know what half of ’em are doing. Among other
things, you made what I think is probably a top-bracket
perceiver out of me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So? Well, don’t peek at me, please .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but why should I
say that, after having studied in Rigel Four for two
years? Women are funny, I guess. But, for your information,
I have just extracted the ninth root of an eighteen-digit
number, in no time at all and to the last significant
decimal place, and I <span class='it'>know</span> the answer is right. How do
you like <span class='it'>them</span> potatoes, Buster?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nice. We really absorbed each other’s stuff, didn’t we?
But how about joining me in person for a soupcon of ham
and eggs?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a thought, my thoughtful friend; a cogent and
right knightly thought. I’ll be with you in three jerks and a
wiggle.” And she was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just as they finished eating, Vesta breezed in. “Well,
you two deep-sleepers finally crawled out of your sacks, did
you? It is confusing, though, that ship’s time never agrees
with planetary time. But I live here, you know, in this city
you call ‘Vegiaton,’ so I went to bed at noon yesterday
and I’ve got over half a day’s work done already. I saw
my folks and bought half of my uncle’s bank and made
the no-gambling declaration and I want to ask you both
something. After the Grand Uproar here at the ’port in
your honor, will you two and Helen and Joe and Bob and
Barbara come with me to a little dance some of my
friends are having? You’ve been <span class='it'>zo</span> good to me, and I want
to show you off a little.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll be <span class='it'>glad</span> to, Vesta, and thanks a lot,” Joan said,
flashing a thought at Cloud to let her handle this thing her
own way, “and I imagine the others would be, too, but
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well, it’s for <span class='it'>you</span>, you know, and we might be intruding.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, not at all!” Vesta waved the objection away with
an airy flirt of her tail. “You’re friends of mine! And
everybody’s real friends are always welcome, you know,
everywhere. And it’ll be small and quiet; only six or eight
hundred are being asked, they say.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” she paused for a
moment: “.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. of course, after it gets around that we have
<span class='it'>you</span> there, a couple of thousand or so strangers will come
in too; but they’ll all smell nice, so it’ll be QX.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you know what they’ll smell like?” Cloud
asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, they’ll smell like our crowd, of course. If they
didn’t they wouldn’t <span class='it'>want</span> to come in. It’s QX, then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For us two, yes; but of course we can’t speak for the
others.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks, you wonderful people; I’ll go ask them right
now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Joan, have you blown your stack completely?” Cloud
demanded. “Small—quiet—six or eight <span class='it'>hundred</span> invited—a
couple of thousand or <span class='it'>so</span> gate-crashers—what do you
want to go to a brawl like <span class='it'>that</span> for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The chance is too good to miss—it’s priceless.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” She
paused, then added, obliquely: “Storm, have you any idea
at all of what Vesta thinks of you? You haven’t snooped,
I’m sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, and I don’t intend to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe you ought to,” Joan snickered a little, “except
that it would inflate your ego too much. It’s hard to
describe. It’s not exactly love—and not exactly worship,
either god-worship or hero-worship. It isn’t exactly adoration,
but it’s very much stronger than mere admiration. A
mixture of all these, perhaps, and half a dozen others,
coupled with a simply unbelievable amount of <span class='it'>pride</span> that
you are her friend. It’s a peculiarly Vegian thing, that
Tellurians simply do not feel. But here’s why I’m so
enthused. It has been over twenty years since any non-Vegian
has attended one of these uniquely Vegian parties
except as an outsider, and a Vegian party with outsiders
looking on isn’t a Vegian party at all. But we Storm, will
be going as insiders!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you sure of that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Positive. Oh, I know it isn’t <span class='it'>us</span> she wants, but <span class='it'>you</span>; but
that won’t make any difference. As Vesta’s friend—‘friend’
in this case having a very special meaning—you’re
in the center of the inner circle. As friends of yours, the
rest of us are in, too. Not in the inner circle, perhaps, but
well inside the outside circle, at least. See?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dimly. ‘A friend of a friend of a friend of a very good
friend of mine,’ eh? I’ve heard that ditty, but I never
thought it meant anything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It does here. We’re going to have a time. See you in
about an hour?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just about. I’ve got to check with Nordquist.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here I am, Storm,” the Lensman’s thought came in.
Then, as Cloud went toward his quarters, it went on:
“Just want to tell you we won’t have anything for you to
do here. This is going to be a straight combing job.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That won’t be too tough, will it? A Tellurian, sixty,
tall, thin, grave, distinguished-looking .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or maybe.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exactly. You’re getting the idea. Cosmeticians and
plastic surgery. He could look like a Crevenian, or thirty
years old and two hundred pounds and slouchy. He could
look like anything. He undoubtedly has a background so
perfectly established that fifteen thoroughly honest Vegians
would swear by eleven of their gods that he hasn’t left his
home town for ten years. So every intelligent being on
Vegia who hasn’t got a live tail, with live blood circulating
in it, is going under the Lens and through the wringer if
we have to keep Vegia in quarantine for a solid year. He
is <span class='it'>not</span> going to get away from us this time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m betting on you, Nordquist. Clear ether!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Lensman signed off and Cloud, at the end of the
specified hour, undressed and redressed and went to the
computer room. All the others except Joe were already
there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hi, peoples!” Cloud called; then did a double-take.
“Wow! And likewise, Yipes! How come the tri-di outfits
didn’t all collapse, Joan, when those two spectaculars took
up cybernetics?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll never know, Storm.” Joan shook her head wonderingly,
then went on via thought; and Cloud felt her pang of
sheer jealousy. “Why is it that big girls are always so
much more beautiful than little ones? And the more
clothes they take off the better they look? It simply isn’t
<span class='it'>fair</span>!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cloud’s mind reached out and meshed with hers. “Sure
it is, sweetheart. They’re beauties; you can’t take that
away from them.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And beauties they certainly were. Helen, as has been
said, was lissom and dark. Her hair was black, her eyes a
midnight blue, her skin a deep, golden brown. Barbara,
not quite as tall—five feet seven, perhaps—was equally
beautifully proportioned, and even more striking-looking.
Her skin was tanned ivory, her eyes were gray, her hair
was a shoulder-length, carefully-careless mass of gleaming,
flowing, wavy silver.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they’ve got a lot of stuff: but believe me, there are
several grand lots of stuff they <span class='it'>haven’t</span> got, too. I wouldn’t
trade half of you for either one of them—or both of them
together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe that—at least, about <span class='it'>both</span> of them,” Joan
giggled mentally, “but how many men.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, how many men do you want?” Cloud interrupted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Touché, Storm .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but do you really.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>What would have developed into a scene of purely
mental lovemaking was put to an end by the arrival of Joe
Mackay, who also paused and made appropriate noises of
appreciation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But there’s one thing I don’t quite like about this
deal,” he said finally. “I’m not too easy in my mind about
making love to a moll who is packing a Mark Twenty
Eight DeLameter. The darn thing might go off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Keep your distance, then, Lieutenant Mackay!” Helen
laughed. “Well, are we ready?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were. They left the ship and walked in a group
through the throng of cheering Vegians toward the nearby,
gaily-decorated stands in which the official greetings and
thank-yous were to take place. Helen and Babs loved it;
just as though they were parading as finalists in a beauty
contest. Bob and Joe wished that they had stayed in the
ship and kept their clothes on. Joan didn’t quite know
whether she liked this kind of thing or not. Of the six
Tellurians, only Neal Cloud had had enough experience in
public near-nudity so that it made no difference. And
Vesta?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vesta was fairly reveling—openly, unashamedly reveling—in
the spotlight with her Tellurian friends. They
reached the center stand, were ushered with many flourishes
to a reserved section already partly filled by Captain
Ross and the lesser officers and crewmen of the good-will-touring
Patrol ship <span class='it'>Vortex Blaster II</span>. Not all of the
officers, of course, since many had to stay aboard, and
comparatively few of the crew; for many men insist on
wearing Tellurian garmenture and refuse to tan their hides
under ultra-violet radiation—and no untanned white Tellurian
skin can take with impunity more than a few
minutes of giant Vega’s blue-white fury.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of the ceremonies themselves, nothing need be said;
such things being pretty much of a piece, wherever, whenever,
or for whatever reason held. When they were over,
Vesta gathered her six friends together and led them to
the edge of the roped-off area. There she uttered a soundless
(to Tellurian ears) whistle, whereupon a group of
Vegian youths and girls formed a wedge around the seven
and drove straight through the milling crowd to its edge.
There, by an evidently pre-arranged miracle, they found
enough copters to carry them all.</p>

<p class='noindent'>THE NEARER THEY got to their destination the more
fidgety Vesta became. “Oh, I <span class='it'>hope</span> Zambkptkn could get
away and be there by now—I haven’t seen him for over
half a year!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who?” Helen asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My brother. Zamke, you’d better call him, you can
pronounce that. The police officer, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought you saw him this morning?” Joan said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I saw my other brothers and sisters, but not him—he
was tied up on a job. He wasn’t sure just when he could
get away tonight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The copter dropped sharply. Vesta seized Cloud’s arm
and pointed. “That’s where we’re going; that big building
with the landing-field on the roof. The Caravanzerie. Zee?”
In moments of emotion or excitement, most of Vesta’s
sibilants reverted to Z’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see. And this is your Great White Way?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was, but it was not white. Instead, it was a blaze of
red, blue, green, yellow—all the colors of the spectrum.
And crowds! On foot, on bicycles, on scooters, motorbikes,
and motortricycles, in cars and in copters, it seemed
impossible that <span class='it'>anything</span> could move in such a press as
that. And as the aircab approached its destination Neal
Cloud, space-hardened veteran and skillful flyer though he
was, found himself twisting wheels, stepping on pedals,
and cutting in braking jets, none of which were there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How that jockey landed his heap and got it into the air
again all in one piece without dismembering a single
Vegian, Cloud never did quite understand. Blades were
scant fractional inches from blades and rotors; people
were actually shoved aside by the tapering bumpers of the
cab as it hit the deck; but nothing happened. This, it
seemed, was <span class='it'>normal</span>!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The group re-formed and in flying-wedge fashion as
before, gained the elevators and finally the ground floor
and the ballroom. Here Cloud drew his first full breath for
what seemed like hours. The ballroom was tremendous—and
it was less than three-quarters filled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just inside the doorway Vesta paused, sniffing delicately.
“He <span class='it'>is</span> here—come on!” She beckoned the six to follow
her and rushed ahead, to be met at the edge of the clear
space in head-on collision. Brother and sister embraced
fervently for about two seconds. Then, reaching down, the
man broke his sister’s grip and flipped her around sidewise,
through half of a vertical circle, so that her feet
pointed straight up. Then, with a sharp “<span class='it'>Blavzkt!</span>” he
snapped into a back flip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Blavzkt—Zemp!</span>” she shouted back, bending beautifully
into such an arch that, as his feet left the floor, hers
landed almost exactly where his had been an instant before.
Then for a full minute and a half the joyous pair
pinwheeled, without moving from the spot; while the
dancers on the floor, standing still now, applauded enthusiastically
with stamping, hand-clapping, whistles, cat-calls,
and screams.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vesta stopped the exhibition finally, and led her brother
toward Cloud and Joan. The music resumed, but the
dancers did not. Instead, they made a concerted rush for
the visitors, surrounding them in circles a dozen deep.
Vesta, with both arms wrapped tightly around Cloud and
her tail around Joan, shrieked a highly consonantal sentence—which
Cloud knew meant “Lay off these two for a
couple of minutes, you howling hyenas, they’re mine”—then,
switching to English: “Go ahead, you four, and have
fun!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first two men to lay hands on the two tall Tellurian
beauties were, by common consent and without argument,
their first partners. Two of the Vegian girls, however,
were not so polite. Both had hold of Joe, one by each
arm, and stood there spitting insults at each other past his
face until a man standing near by snapped a few words at
them and flipped a coin. The two girls, each still maintaining
her grip, leaned over eagerly to see for themselves the
result of the toss. The loser promptly relinquished her hold
on Joe and the winner danced away with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, this is <span class='it'>wonderful</span>, Storm!” Joan thought. “We’ve
been <span class='it'>accepted</span>—we’re the first group I ever actually <span class='it'>knew</span>
of to really break through the crust.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Vegians moved away. Vesta released her captives
and turned to her brother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Captain Cloud, Doctor Janowick, I present to you my
brother Zamke,” she said. Then, to her brother: “They
have been very good to me, Zambktpkn, both of them,
but especially the captain. You know what he did for
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I know.” The brother spoke the English “S” with
barely a trace of hardness. He shook Cloud’s hand firmly,
then bent over the hand, spreading it out so that the palm
covered his face, and inhaled deeply. Then, straightening
up: “For what you have done for my sister, sir, I thank
you. As she has said, your scent is pleasing and will be
remembered long, enshrined in the Place of Pleasant
Odors of our house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Turning to Joan, and omitting the handshake, he repeated
the performance and bowed—and when an adult
male Vegian sets out to make a production of bowing, it is
a production well worth seeing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, with the suddenest and most complete change of
manner either Cloud or Joan had ever seen he said:
“Well, now that the formalities have been taken care of,
Joan, how about us hopping a couple of skips around the
floor?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joan was taken slightly aback, but rallied quickly.
“Why, I’d love it .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but not knowing either the steps or
the music, I’m afraid I couldn’t follow you very well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh that won’t make any.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” Zamke began, but Vesta
drowned him out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of <span class='it'>course</span> it won’t make any difference, Joan!” she
exclaimed. “Just go ahead and dance any way you want
to. He’ll match your steps—and if he so much as touches
one of your slippers with his big, fat feet, I’ll choke him to
death with his own tail!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I suppose it is irrefutable that you can and will
dance with me with equal dexterity, aplomb, and insouciance?”
Cloud asked Vesta, quizzically, after Joan and
Zamke had glided smoothly out into the throng.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You zaid it, little chum!” Vesta exclaimed, gleefully.
“And I know what all those words mean, too, and if I
ztep on either one of <span class='it'>your</span> feet I’ll choke <span class='it'>my</span> zelf to death
with my <span class='it'>own</span> tail, zo there!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Snuggling up to him blissfully, Vesta let him lead her
into the crowd. She of course was a superb dancer; so
much so that she made him think himself a much better
dancer than he really was. After a few minutes, when he
was beginning to relax, he felt an itchy, tickling touch—something
almost impalpable was creeping up his naked
back—the fine, soft fur of the extreme tip of Vesta’s
ubiquitous tail!</p>

<p class='pindent'>He grabbed for it, but, fast as he was, Vesta was faster,
and she shrieked with glee as he missed the snatch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See here, young lady,” he said, with mock sternness,
“if you don’t keep your tail where it belongs I’m going to
wrap it around your lovely neck and tie it into a bow-knot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vesta sobered instantly. “Oh .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. do you <span class='it'>really</span> think I’m
lovely, Captain Nealcloud—my neck, I mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No doubt about it,” Cloud declared. “Not only your
neck—all of you. You are most certainly one of the most
beautiful things I ever saw.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, thanks .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I hadn’t.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” she stared into his eyes
for moments, as if trying to decide whether he really
meant it or was merely being polite; then, deciding that he
did mean it, she closed her eyes, let her head sink down
onto his shoulder, and began to purr blissfully; still
matching perfectly whatever motions he chose to make.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a few minutes, however, they heard a partially-stifled
shriek and a soprano voice, struggling with laughter, rang
out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Vesta!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Babs?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you do about this tail-tickling business? I
never had to cope with anything like <span class='it'>that</span> before!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bite him!” Vesta called back, loudly enough for half
the room to hear. “Bite him good and hard, on the end of
the tail. If you can’t catch the tail, bite his ear. Bite it
good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Bite</span> him? Why, I <span class='it'>couldn’t</span>—not <span class='it'>possibly</span>!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then give him the knee, or clout him a good,
solid tunk on the nose. Or better yet; tell him you won’t
dance with him any more—he’ll be good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Now</span> you tell us what to do about tail-ticklers,” Cloud
said then. “S’pose I’d take a good bite at <span class='it'>your</span> ear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d bite you right back,” said Vesta, gleefully, “and I
bet you’d taste just as nice as you smell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dance went on, and Cloud finally, by the aid of
both Vesta and Zamke, did finally manage to get one
dance with Joan. And, as he had known he would, he
enjoyed it immensely. So did she.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Having fun, chum? I never saw you looking so starry-eyed
before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, brother!” she breathed. “To say that I was never
the belle of any ball in my schooldays is the understatement
of the century, but here .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. can you imagine it,
Storm, <span class='it'>me</span> actually outshining Barbara Benton and Helen
Worthington both at once?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure I can. I told you.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course it’s probably because their own women are
so big that I’m a sort of curiosity,” she rushed on, “but
whatever the reason, this dance is going down in my
memory book in great big letters in the reddest ink I can
find!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good for you—hail the conquering heroine!” he applauded.
“It’ll do you good to have your ego inflated a
little. But what do <span class='it'>you</span> do about this tail-tickling routine?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I grab their tails”—with her sense of perception,
she could, of course—“and when they try to wiggle them
free I wiggle back at them, like this,” she demonstrated,
“and we have a perfectly wonderful time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wow! I’ll bet you do—and when I get you home, you
shameless.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sorry, Storm, my friend,” the big Vegian who cut in
wasn’t sorry at all, and he and Cloud both knew it. “You
can dance with Joan any time and we can’t. So loosen all
clamps, friend. Grab him, Vzelkt!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vzelkt grabbed. So, in about a minute, did another
Vegian girl; and then after a few more minutes, it was
Vesta’s turn again. No other girl could dance with him
more than once, but Vesta, by some prearranged priority,
could have him once every ten minutes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where’s your brother, Vesta?” he asked once. “I
haven’t seen him for an hour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, he had to go back to the police station. They’re all
excited and working all hours. They’re chasing Public
Enemy Number One—a Tellurian, they think he is, named
Fairchild—why?” as Cloud started, involuntarily, in the
circle of her arm. “Do you know him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know <span class='it'>of</span> him, and that’s enough.” Then, in thought:
“Did you get that, Nordquist?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I got it.” Cloud was, as the Lensman had said that he
would be, under surveillance every second. “Of course,
this one may not be Fairchild, since there are three or
four other suspects in other places, but from the horrible
time we and the Vegians both are having, trying to locate
this bird, I’m coming to think he is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dance went on until, some hours later, there was
an unusual tumult and confusion at the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, the police are calling Vesta—something has happened!”
his companion exclaimed. “Let’s rush over—oh,
hurry!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cloud hurried; but, as well as hurrying, he sent his sense
of perception on ahead, and meshed his mind imperceptibly
with Vesta’s as well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her mind was a queerly turbid, violently turbulent mixture
of emotions: hot with a furiously passionate lust for
personal, tooth-and-claw-revenge; at the same time icily
cold with the implacable, unswervable resolve of the dedicated,
remorseless, and merciless killer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you sure, beyond all doubt, that this is the garment
of my brother’s slayer?” Vesta was demanding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sure,” the Vegian policeman replied. “Not only
did Zambkptkn hold it pierced by the first and fourth
fingers of his left hand—the sign positive, as you know—but
an eyewitness verified the scent and furnished descriptions.
The slayer was dressed as an Aldebaranian, which
accounts for the size of the garment your brother could
seize before he died; his four bodyguards as Tellurians,
with leather belts and holsters for their blasters.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“QX.” Vesta accepted a pair of offered shears and
began to cut off tiny pieces of the cloth. As each piece
began to fall it was seized in mid-air by a Vegian man or
girl who immediately ran away with it. And in the meantime
other Vegians, forming into a long line, ran past
Vesta, each taking a quick sniff and running on, out into
the street. Cloud, reaching outside the building with his
perceptors, saw that all vehicular traffic had paused. A
Vegian stood on the walkway, holding a bit of cloth
pinched between thumb and fingernail. All passersby, on
foot or in any kind of vehicle, would pause, sniff at the
cloth, and—apparently—go on about their business.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Cloud, after reading Vesta’s mind and the policeman’s,
turned as white as his space-tan would permit. In
less than an hour almost every Vegian in that city of over
eight million would know the murderer by scent and
would be sniffing eagerly for him; and when any one of
them <span class='it'>did</span> find him.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Except for the two Vegians and the six Tellurians, the
vast hall was now empty. Vesta was holding a pose Cloud
had never before seen—stiffly erect, with her tail wrapped
tightly around her body.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can they get a scent—a <span class='it'>reliable</span> scent, I mean—that
fast?” Cloud asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Zertainly,” Vesta’s voice was cold, level, almost
uninflected. “How long would it take you to learn that an
egg you started to eat was rotten? The man who wore this
shirt is a class A Triple Prime stinker—his odor is recognizable
instantly and anywhere.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But as to the rest of it—<span class='it'>don’t</span> do this thing, Vesta! Let
the law handle it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The law comes second. He killed my brother; it is my
right and my privilege to kill him.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cloud became conscious of the fact that Joan was in his
mind. “You been here all along?” he flashed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In or near. You and I are one, you know,” and Vesta’s
voice went on:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and besides, the law is merciful. Its death is instant.
Under my claws and teeth he will live for hours—for
a full day, I hope.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But officer, can’t <span class='it'>you</span> do something?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing. The law comes second. As she has said, it is
her right and her privilege.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it’s suicide, man—sheer <span class='it'>suicide</span>. You know that,
don’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not necessarily. She will not be working alone. Whether
she lives or dies, however, it is still her right and her
privilege.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cloud switched to thought. “Nordquist, <span class='it'>you</span> can stop
this if you want to. <span class='it'>Do</span> it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t, and you know I can’t. The Patrol does not and
cannot interfere in purely planetary affairs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You intend, then,” Cloud demanded furiously, “to let
this girl put her naked hands and teeth up against four
trigger-happy gunnies with DeLameters?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just that. There’s nothing else I or any other Patrolman
can do. To interfere in this one instance would
alienate half the planets of Civilization and set the Patrol
back five hundred years.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, even though I’m a Patrolman—of sorts—<span class='it'>I</span> can
do something about it!” Cloud blazed, “and by God, I
will!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>We</span> will, you mean, and we <span class='it'>will</span>, too,” Joan’s thought
came forcibly at first, then became dubious: “That is, if it
doesn’t mean getting <span class='it'>you</span> blasted, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just what?” Nordquist’s thought was sharp. “Oh, I see
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and, being a Vegian, as well as a Patrolman, and the
acknowledged friend of both the dead man and his sister.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who’s a Vegian?” Cloud demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are, and so are the other five of your group, as
you would have been informed if the party had not been
broken up so violently. Honorary Vegians, for life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, I never <span class='it'>heard</span> of such a thing!” Joan exclaimed,
“and I studied them for years!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, you never did,” Nordquist agreed. “There haven’t
been many honorary Vegians, and to my certain knowledge,
not one of them has ever talked. Vegians are very
strongly psychic in picking their off-world friends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean to tell me that that bleached blonde over
there won’t spill everything she knows fifteen minutes
after we leave here?” Cloud demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just that. You can’t judge character by hair, even if it
were bleached, which it isn’t. You owe her an apology,
Storm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you say so, I do, and I hereby apologize, but.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But to get back to the subject,” the Lensman went on,
narrowing his thought down so sharply as to exclude Joan.
“You can do something. You’re the <span class='it'>only</span> one who can.
Such being the case, and since you are no longer indispensable.
I withdraw all objections. Go ahead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cloud started a thought, but Joan blanked him out.
“Lensman, has Storm been sending—<span class='it'>can</span> he send information
to you that <span class='it'>I</span> can’t dig out of his mind?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very easily. He is an exceptionally fine tuner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry, Joanie,” Cloud thought, hastily, “but it
sounded too much like bragging to let you in on. However,
you’re in from now on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, aloud, “Vesta, I’m staying with you,” he said,
quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was sure you would,” she said, as quietly. “You are
my friend and Zamke’s. Although your customs are not
exactly like ours, a man of your odor does not desert his
friends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cloud turned then to the four lieutenants, who stood
close-grouped. “Will you four kids please go back to the
ship, and take Joan with you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not on Thursdays, Storm,” Joe said, pointing to an
inconspicuous bronze button set into a shoulder-strap. “We
both rate Blaster Expert First. Count us in,” and Bob
added:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Joan has been telling us an earful, and what she didn’t
tell us a couple of Vegian boys did. The Three Honorary
Vegian Musketeers; that’s us. Lead on, d’Artagnan!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bob and Joe are staying, too, Vesta,” Cloud said then.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course. I’m sorry I didn’t get to tell you myself
about being adopted, but I knew somebody would. But
you, Joan and Barbara and Helen, you three had better go
back to the ship. You can be of no use here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two of them were willing enough to go, but:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where Neal Cloud goes, I go,” Joan said, and there
was no doubt whatever that she meant exactly that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?” Vesta demanded. “Commander Cloud, the fastest
gunman in all space, is necessary for the success of
this our mission. He can, from a cold, bell-tone start, at
thirty yards, burn the centers out of six irregularly-spaced
targets.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nordquist! Lay off! What in <span class='it'>hell</span> do you think you’re
doing?” Cloud thought, viciously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think—I <span class='it'>know</span>,” came instant reply. “Do you
want her hanging on your left arm when the blasting
starts? This is the only <span class='it'>possible</span> way Joan Janowick can be
handled. Lay off yourself!” and Vesta’s voice went calmly
on:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in exactly two hundred and forty nine mils. Lieutenant
Mackay and Lieutenant Ingalls, although perhaps
not absolutely necessary, are highly desirable. They
are fast enough, and are of deadly accuracy. When either
of them shoots a man in a crowd, however large, that one
man dies, and not a dozen bystanders. Now just what
good would <span class='it'>you</span> be, Lieutenant-Commander Janowick?
Can you fire a blaster with any one of these men? Or bite
a man’s throat out with me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For probably the first time in her life, Joan Janowick
stood mute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And suppose you <span class='it'>do</span> come along,” Vesta continued
relentlessly. “With <span class='it'>you</span> at his side, in the line of fire, do
you suppose.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just a minute—shut up, Vesta!” Cloud ordered, roughly.
“Listen, all of you. The Lensman is doing this, not
Vesta, and I’ll be damned if I’ll let anybody, not even a
Lensman, bedevil my Joan this way. So, Joan, wherever
we go, you can come along. All I ask is, you’ll keep a little
ways back?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I will, Storm,” and Joan crept into the
shelter of his arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha—I thought you’d pop off at about this point,”
Nordquist’s thought came chattily into Cloud’s mind.
“Good work, my boy; you’ve consolidated your position
no end.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what do we do now?” Joe Mackay broke the
somewhat sticky silence that followed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We wait,” Vesta said, calmly. “We wait right here
until we receive news.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They waited; and, as they waited the tension mounted
and mounted. Before it became intolerable, however, the
news came in, and Cloud, reading Vesta’s mind as the
ultra-sonic information was received, relayed it to other
Tellurians. The murderer and his four bodyguards were at
that moment entering a theater less than one city block
away.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, they <span class='it'>couldn’t</span> be!” Helen protested. “<span class='it'>Nobody</span>
could be <span class='it'>that</span> stupid .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I wonder.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder, too.” This from Joan. “Yes, it would be the
supremely clever thing to do; the perfect place to hide for
a few hours while the worst of the storm blows over and
they can complete their planned getaway. Provided, of
course, they’re out-worlders and thus don’t know what
we Vegians can do with our wonderful sense of smell. Of
course they aren’t a Tellurian and four Aldebaranians any
more, are they?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, they are five Centralians now. Perfectly innocent.
They think their blasters are completely hidden under
those long over shirts, but now and again a bulge shows—they’ve
still got blasters on their hips. The theater’s
crowded, but the five friends want to sit together. The
manager thinks it could be arranged, by paying a small
gratuity to a few seat-holders who would like to make a
fast credit that way .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he’ll place them and it’s almost
time for us to go. ’Bye, Joanie—stay back, remember!”
and she was in his arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How about it, Helen?” Joe asked. “Surely you’re going
to kiss your Porthos good-bye, aren’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of a surety, m’enfant!” she exclaimed, and did so with
enthusiasm. “But it’s more like Aramis, I think—he kissed
everybody, you know—and since I’m not hooked like Joan
is—yet—don’t think that this is establishing a precedent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Babs, that leaves you and me.” Bob reached
out—she was standing beside him—and pulled her close.
“QX?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, I .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I guess so.” Barbara blushed furiously. “But
Bob .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is it really <span class='it'>dangerous</span>?” she whispered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know. Not very, really, I don’t think. At least I
certainly <span class='it'>hope</span> not. But blasters are <span class='it'>not</span> cap-pistols, you
know, and whenever one goes off it can raise pure hell.
Why? Would you really miss me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You <span class='it'>know</span> I would, Bob,” and her kiss had more
fervor than either she or he would have believed possible a
few minutes before. And at its end she laughed, shakily,
and blushed again as she said, “I’ve got sort of used to
having you around, so be <span class='it'>sure</span> and come back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They left the building and walked rapidly along a
strangely quiet street to the theater. Without a word they
were ushered up a short flight of stairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hold up, Vesta!” Cloud thought sharply. “We can’t see
a thing—wait a couple of minutes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They waited five minutes, during which time they
learned exactly where the enemy were and discussed every
detail of the proposed attack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I <span class='it'>still</span> can’t see well enough to shoot,” Cloud said then.
“Can they give us a little glow of light?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They could. By almost imperceptible increments the
thick, soft blackness was relieved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s enough.” The light, such as it was, steadied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ready?” Vesta’s voice was a savage growl, low, deep
in her throat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ready.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No more noise, then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They walked forward to the balcony’s edge, leaned over
it, looked down. Directly beneath Vesta’s head was seated
a man in Centralian garb; four others were behind, in
front of, and at each side of, their chief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now!” Vesta yelled, and flung herself over the low
railing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At her shout four Vegians ripped four Centralian shirts
apart, seized four hip-holstered blasters, and shouted with
glee—but they shouted too soon. For the real gun-slick,
then as now, did not work from the hip, but out of his
sleeve; and these were four of the coldest, fastest killers to
be found throughout the far flung empire of Boskone.
Thus, all four flashed into action even before they began
rising to their feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But so did Storm Cloud; and his heavy weapon was
already out and ready. He knew what those hands were
doing, in the instant of their starting to do it, and his
DeLameter flamed three times in what was practically one
very short blast. He had to move a little before he could
sight on the fourth guard—Vesta’s furiously active body
was in the way—so Joe and Bob each got a shot, too.
Three bolts of lightning hit that luckless wight at once,
literally cremating him in air as he half-crouched, bringing
his blaster to bear on the catapulting thing attacking his
boss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Vesta went over the rail she did not jump to the
floor below. Instead, her hands locked on the edge; her
feet dug into the latticework of the apron. She squatted.
Her tail flashed down, wrapping itself twice around the
zwilnik’s neck. She heaved, then, and climbed with everything
she had; and as she stood upright on the railing,
eager hands reached down to help her tail lift its burden
up into the balcony. The man struck the floor with a thud
and Vesta jumped at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your fingers first—one at a time,” she snarled; and,
seizing a hand, she brought it toward her mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She paused then as if thunderstruck; a dazed, incredulous
expression spreading over her face. Bending over, she
felt, curiously, tenderly, of his neck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, he .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he’s <span class='it'>dead</span>!” she gasped. “His neck .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it’s
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it’s <span class='it'>broken</span>! From such a little, tiny pull as <span class='it'>that</span>? Why,
<span class='it'>anybody</span> ought to have a stronger neck than <span class='it'>that</span>!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She straightened up; then, as a crowd of Vegians and
the Tellurian women came up, she became instantly her
old, gay self. “Well, shall we all go back and finish our
dance?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What?” Cloud demanded. “After <span class='it'>this</span>?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why certainly,” Vesta said, brightly. “I’m sorry, of
course, that I killed him so quickly, but it doesn’t make
any real difference. Zamke is avenged; he can now enjoy
himself. We’ll join him in a few years, more or less. Until
then, what would you do? What you call ‘mourn’?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I simply don’t know,” Cloud said,
slowly, his arm tightening around Joan’s supple waist. “I
thought I’d seen everything, but .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I suppose you can
have somebody take that body out to the ship, so they can
check it for identity?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, I’ll do that. Right away. You’re sure you don’t
want to dance any more?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very sure, my dear. <span class='it'>Very</span> sure. All <span class='it'>I</span> want to do is take
Joan back to the ship.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“QX. I won’t see you again this trip, then; your hours
are so funny. I’ll send for my things. And I won’t say
good-bye, Captain Nealcloud and you other wonderful
people, because we’ll see each other again, soon and
often. Just so-long, and thanks tremendously for all you
have done for me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Vesta the Vegian strode away, purring contentedly
to herself—tail high.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='171' id='Page_171'></span><h1 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>Chapter 17</span><br/> ▂▂▂▂▂▂<span style='font-size:larger'>THE CALL</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'>THE LENSMEN and their Patrolmen, having made sure
that the body of Zamke’s murderer was in fact that of the
long-sought Fairchild, went unostentatiously about their
various businesses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The six Tellurians, although shaken no little by their
climactic experience on Vegia, returned soon to normal
and resumed their accustomed routines of life—with certain
outstanding variations. Thus, Helen and Joe flirted
joyously and sparred dextrously, but neither was ever to
be found tête-à-tête with anyone else. And thus, Bob and
Barbara, neither flirting nor sparring, became quietly but
enthusiastically inseparable. And thus, between Joan and
Cloud, so close even before Vegia, the bonding became so
tight that their two minds were, to all intents and purposes,
one mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The week on Vegia was over. The <span class='it'>Vortex Blaster II</span>
was loafing through the void at idling speed. Cloud was
pacing the floor in his office. Joan, lounging in a deeply-cushioned
chair with legs stuck out at an angle of forty-five
degrees to each other, was smoking a cigarette and
watching him, with her eyes agleam.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Confound it, I wish they’d hurry up with that fine-tooth,”
he said, flipping his half-smoked cigarette at a
receptacle and paying no attention to the fact that he
missed it by over a foot. “How can I tell Captain Ross
where to go when I don’t know myself?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s one thing I just <span class='it'>love</span> about you, my pet,” Joan
drawled. “You’re so wonderfully, so superhumanly <span class='it'>patient</span>.
You know as well as I do that the absolutely
irreducible minimum of time is twenty-six minutes from
now, and that they’ll probably find something they’ll want
to study for a minute or so after they get there. So light
somewhere, why don’t you, and unseethe yourself?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Touché, Joan.” He sat down with a thump. “Has
Doctor Janowick a prescription specific for the ailment?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing else but, chum. That tight-linkage snooping
that we’ve been going to try, but never had time for. Let’s
start on Helen and Barbara. I’ve snooped them repeatedly,
of course, but our fusion of minds, theoretically, should
be able to pick their minds apart cell by cell; to tap their
subconscious ancestral memories, even—if there are such
things—for a thousand generations back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at her curiously. “You know, I think you
must have some ghoul blood in you somewhere? I tell you
again, those girls are <span class='it'>friends</span> of ours!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So what?” she grinned at him, entirely unabashed.
“You’ll have to get rid of that squeamishness some day;
it’s the biggest roadblock there is on the Way of Knowledge.
If not them, how would Nadine suit you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Worse yet. She’s just as good at this business as we
are, maybe better, and she probably wouldn’t like it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may have something there. We’ll save her for
last, and call on her formally, with announcements and
everything. Vesta, then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Now</span> you’re squeaking, little mouse. But no deep digging
for a while. We’ll take it easy and light—we don’t
want to do any damage we may not be able to undo. As I
told you before, my brain is firing on altogether too damn
many barrels that I simply don’t know what are doing.
Let’s go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They fused their minds—an effortless process now—and
were at their objective instantaneously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vesta was primping; enjoying sensuously the physical
feel of her physical body even as dozens of parts of speech
of dozens of different languages went through her racing
mind. And, one layer down, she was wishing she were old
enough to be a newlywed; wishing she had a baby of her
own .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. babies were so cute and soft and cuddlesome.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Tommie. Cloud and Joan enjoyed with her the
strong, rank, sense-satisfying flavor of a Venerian cigar
and studied with her the intricate electronic equations of a
proposed modification of the standard deep space drive.
And, one layer down, the Tomingan engineer, too, was
thinking of love and of babies. What was all this space
hopping getting her, anyway? It didn’t stop the ache, fill
the void, satisfy the longing. As soon as this cruise was
over, she was going back to Tominga, tell Hanko she was
ready, and settle down. A husband and a family did tie a
woman down something fierce—but what price freedom
to wander when you wake up in the middle of the night
from dreaming of a baby in your arms, only to find the
baby isn’t there?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Thlaskan and Maluleme. They were seated, arms
around each other, on a davenport in their own home
on Chickladoria. They were not talking, merely feeling.
They were deeply, truly, tremendously in love. In the
man’s mind there was a background of his work, of
pilotry, of orbits and charts and computations. There was
a flash of sincere liking for Cloud, the best boss and the
finest figure-man he had ever known; but practically all of
his mind was full of love for the wonderful woman at his
side. In hers, at the moment, there were only two things;
love of her husband and longing for the child which she
might already have succeeded in conceiving.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cloud wrenched their linked minds away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is monstrous, Joan!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s monstrous about it?” she asked, quietly. “Nothing.
It isn’t. Women <span class='it'>need</span> children, Storm. All women,
everywhere. Now that I’ve found <span class='it'>you</span>, I can scarcely wait
to have some myself. And listen, Storm, please. Before we
visit Nadine, you <span class='it'>must</span> make up your mind to face facts—<span class='it'>any</span>
kind of facts—without flinching and shying away and
getting mental goose-bumps all over your psyche.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see what you mean. In a fully telepathic race there
couldn’t be any real privacy without a continuous block,
and that probably wouldn’t be very feasible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, you <span class='it'>don’t</span> see what I mean. You aren’t even on
the right road—your whole <span class='it'>concept</span> is wrong. There
couldn’t be any <span class='it'>thought</span>, even of privacy, no <span class='it'>conception</span> of
such a thing. <span class='it'>Think</span> a minute! From birth—from the very
birth of the whole race—full and open meetings of minds
must have been the norm of thought. That kind of thing
is—must be—what Nadine is accustomed to at home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hm .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I never thought .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you go see her, Joan, and
I’ll stay home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What good would <span class='it'>that</span> do? Whatever you may be, my
dear, I know darn well you’re <span class='it'>not</span> stupid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not exactly stupid, maybe, but I haven’t thought this
thing through the way you have .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. of course, if she’s half
as good as we know she is, she’s read us both already,
clear down to the footings of our foundations .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but this
thing of a <span class='it'>full</span> meeting of minds with anybody but you.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You haven’t a thing to hide, you know. At least, <span class='it'>I</span>
know, whether you do or not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No? How do you figure that? Maybe <span class='it'>you</span> think so, but
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I’ve tried, of course, but I’ve failed a lot oftener than
I succeeded.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who hasn’t? You’re not unique, my dear. Shall we
go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We might as well, I guess .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I’m as ready as I ever
will be.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I’ll try, but.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please do, Master,” came Nadine’s quiet, composed
thought, in a vein completely foreign to her usual attitude
of self-sufficient aloofness. “I have been observing; studying
with awe and with wonder. If you will so deign,
revered Master, come fully into my mind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Deign?” Cloud demanded. “What kind of a thought is
that, Nadine, from you to me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Deign.” Nadine repeated, firmly. Deeply moved, she
was feeling and sending a solemnity of respect Cloud had
never before experienced. “My powers are ordinary, since
I am of Type One. The two greatest Masters of Manarka
are Fives, and have been the greatest Masters of the past.
This is the first time I have ever encountered a mind of a
type higher than Five. Come in, sir, I plead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cloud went in, and his first flash of comparison was that
it was like diving into the pellucid depths of a clean, cool,
utterly transparent mountain lake. This mind was <span class='it'>so</span> different
from Joan’s! Joan’s was rich, warmly sympathetic,
tender and emphatic, yet it was full of dark corners,
secret nooks, recesses, and automatic blocks.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Huh? He
had thought her mind as open as a book, but it wasn’t.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
On the other hand, Nadine’s was wide open by nature. It
was cool, poised—although at the moment uncomfortably
worshipful—and utterly, <span class='it'>shockingly</span> open!</p>

<p class='pindent'>His second thought was that Joan was no longer with
him. She was there, in a sense, but <span class='it'>outside</span>, some way; she
wasn’t in Nadine’s mind the way he was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll say I’m not!” Joan agreed, fervently. “Thank God!
I don’t know what you did or how you did it, but when
you went in you peeled me off like the skin of a banana,
and I was clinging like a leech, too. I’m on the outside,
looking in. Did you see how he did it, Nadine?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, but since I am only a One, such insight would not
be expected. I have called the Fives, and they come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are here.” Two close-linked minds linked themselves
with the two already so closely linked. Each of the
two visitors was grave, kindly, and old with an appalling
weight of years; each mind bore an appalling freight of
knowledge both mundane and esoteric. “We are here,
fellow Master of Thought, to be of aid to you in the
clarification of your newly-awakened mind, to the end
that, in a future time, your superior powers will assist us
along Paths of Truth which we could not otherwise traverse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you please tell me what this is all about?” Cloud
asked. “Starting at the beginning and using words of as
few syllables as possible?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gladly. It has been known for some time that
Janowick is Type Three. Self-developed, partially-developed,
under-developed, struggling against she knew
not what, but still a Three. Now Threes as such, while
eminently noteworthy, are by no means phenomenal.
There are some hundreds of Threes now alive. Being
noteworthy, she has been watched. In time she would have
completed her development and would have taken her
rightful place in the School of Thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You, however, have been a complete enigma to our
most penetrant minds. Since no mind of lower type than
Three can be an instantaneous calculator, it was clear that
you were, basically, at least a Three. However, unlike
other Threes, you did nothing whatever to develop the
latent, potential abilities of whatever type you might be.
Instead and excepting only the small and unimportant
item of computation, you used the tremendous powers of
your mind, not for any constructive purpose whatever, but
only for the application of such rigid controls and suppressions
that all the tremendous abilities you should have
shown remained completely dormant and inert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nor could we do anything about it. We tried, but you
have blocks that not even the full power of two linked
Fives can crack; which fact showed that you are of a type
higher than Five. We were about to come to you in
person, to plead with you, when you met Three Janowick
and opened to her your hitherto impregnably-sealed inner
mind. She does not know, and you do not know, what you
jointly did; which was, in effect, to break and to dissolve
the bindings which had been shackling both your minds.
That brings us to the present. It has now become clear
that you have been Called.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Called?” Cloud winced, physically and mentally. No
man likes to be reminded that he failed Lensman’s Exam.
“You’re wrong. I didn’t make even the first round.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We did not mean the Call of the Lens. There are many
Calls, of which that is only one. Nor is it the highest, as
we have just discovered, in certain little-known aspects of
that vast thing we call the mind. For, to the best of our
knowledge, no Lensman of the present or of the past is or
was of a type higher than Five. The exact nature of your
Call is as yet obscure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d like to buy that, but I’m afraid it’s.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” Cloud
paused. Until he’d met Joan, he’d supposed his mind
ordinary enough. Since then, however .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. all those extra
barrels.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exactly. We are specialists of the mind, young man. We
perceive your mind, not as it is, but as it should be and
will be. It should have and will have a penetrance, a
range, a flexibility of directive force, and, above all, a
scope of heights and depths we have never encountered
before. It is eminently clear that you, and, very probably,
Three Janowick as well, have been developed each for
some specific Purpose in the Great Scheme of Things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A <span class='it'>Purpose</span>?” Cloud demanded. “<span class='it'>What</span> purpose? What
could <span class='it'>I</span> do? What could both of us together do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can not surely know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does that mean that you can make a well-informed
guess? If so, let’s have it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is a very high probability that Three Janowick
was developed specifically to develop you; to pierce and to
dissolve those hampering barriers which were amenable to
no other force. Concerning you, there are several possibilities,
none of which have any very high degree of probability,
since you are unique. The one we prefer at the
moment is that you are to become the greatest living
Master of Thought; the Prime Expounder of the Truth.
But that is of no importance now, since in due time it will
be revealed. Of present import is the fact that both your
minds are confused, cloudy, and disorderly. We offer our
services in reorienting and ordering them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’d like that very much; but first, if I am going to
develop into a mental giant of some kind—frankly, I have
my doubts—why did it wait this long to show up?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The answer to that question is plain and simple. There
is a time for everything, and everything that happens does
so in its exact time. Let us to work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They worked, and when it was done:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We would like to dwell with you for long,” the ancient
Fives said, “but the time for such a boon will not come
until you are much emptier of cares and much fuller of
years.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Fives split apart. “How do you type this new
Master, brother? A full Six, I say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A full Six he is, brother, beyond doubt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They fused. “In a time to come, Six Cloud, we will,
with your help and under your guidance, explore many
and many a Path of Truth which without you would
remain closed. But we observe that there is about to
arrive a message which is to you of some present concern.
Until a day, then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Fives disappeared as suddenly as they had come,
and Cloud began to test and to exercise the new capabilities
of his mind; in much the same fashion as that in which
a good belly-dancer exercises and trains each individual
muscle of her torso.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I didn’t.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. How did they.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ?” Joan
shook her head violently and started all over again. “What
did they <span class='it'>do</span> to us, Storm?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know. It was over my head like a lunar dome.
But it—whatever it was—was exactly what the doctor
ordered. I can handle all those extra barrels now like van Buskirk
handles a space-axe. How about you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me, too—I think.” She hugged his arm. “It shocked
me speechless for a minute, but it’s all settling into place
fast.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But that message? They could get it from your
mind that you expected that fine-tooth pretty soon, but
how could they know it’s coming in right now? We don’t—in
fact, we know it <span class='it'>can’t</span> get here for a good ten minutes
yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish I knew. I’d like to think they were bluffing, but
I know they weren’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hi Storm and Joan!” Philip Strong’s face appeared
upon a screen, his voice came from a speaker. “The
Survey ship has just reported. Technical dope is still coming
in. Communications is buzzing you a tape of the whole
thing, but to save time I thought I’d call you and give you
the gist. To make it short and unsweet, there’s nothing
there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Nothing there!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing for you. They gave it the works, and all there
is to that system, Cahuita, they call it, is one red dwarf
with one red microdwarf circling it planetwise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Huh?” Cloud demanded. “Come again, chief.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How could a micro-sun like that exist?” Strong
laughed. “That had me bothered, too, but they’ve got a lot
of cosmological double-talk to cover it. It’s terrifically
radioactive, they say. And even so, it’s temporary. In the
cosmological sense, that is; a hundred million years or so
either way don’t matter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No solid planets at all? Not even one?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not one. Nothing really liquid, even. Incandescent,
very highly radioactive gas. Nothing solid bigger than your
thumb within twelve parsecs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And so it never has been solid, and won’t be for
millions of years.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Oh, <span class='it'>Damn</span>! Well, thanks, chief, a
lot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, as the Lensman signed off: “Joan, that puts us
deeper in the dark than ever. We had twice too many
unknowns and only half enough knowns before, and this
really tears it. Well, it was a very nice theory while it
lasted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s <span class='it'>still</span> a very nice theory, Storm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Huh? How do you figure that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t have to figure it. Listen! First, that point is
significant, with a probability greater than point nine nine
nine. Second, no other point in space has a probability as
great as point zero zero one. Whoever or whatever was—is—there,
the Survey ship missed. We’ve got to go there
ourselves, Storm. We simply <span class='it'>must</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Was’ is probably right. Whatever used to be there is
gone .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but that doesn’t make sense, either .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that planet
has <span class='it'>never</span> been solid, Joan.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” Cloud got up and began to
pace the floor. “Dammit, Joan, <span class='it'>nothing</span> can live on a
planet like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Life as we know it, no.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean by that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only that I am trying to keep an open mind. We
simply haven’t enough data.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think you and I have got jets enough to find
data that the Patrol’s best experts missed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know. All I am sure of, Doctor Neal Cloud, is
this: If we <span class='it'>don’t</span> go, we’ll both wish we had, to the day we
die.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re probably right .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but I haven’t got a glimmering
of an idea as to what we’re going to look for.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know whether I have or not, but we’ve simply
<span class='it'>got</span> to go. Even if we don’t find anything, we will at least
have tried. Besides, your most pressing work is done, so
you can take the time .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and besides that .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well,
something those Fives said is bothering me terribly .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the
Purpose, you know .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. do you think.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That my Purpose in Life is to go solve the mystery of
the Red Dwarf and its Enigmatic Microcompanion?” he
gibed. “Hardly. Furthermore, the coincidence of the Fives
getting here just one jump ahead of the fine-tooth is
much—<span class='it'>very</span> much—too coincidental.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joan caught her breath and, if possible, paled whiter
than before. “You may <span class='it'>think</span> you’re joking, Storm, but
you aren’t. Believe me, you aren’t. That’s one of the things
that are scaring me witless. You see, if I learned anything
at all in my quite-a-few years of semantics, philosophy,
and logic, it was that coincidence has no more reality than
paradox has. Both are completely meaningless terms. Neither
does or can exist.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cloud paled, then. “You believe that <span class='it'>is</span> my purpose in
life?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now it’s you who are extrapolating.” Joan laughed,
albeit shakily. “To quote you, ‘I merely stated a fact,’ et
cetera.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Facts hurt, when they hit as hard as that one did.”
Cloud paced about, immersed in thought, for minutes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t find any point of attack,” he said, finally. “No
foothold. No finger-hold, even. But what you just said
rocked me to the foundations .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you said, a while back,
that you believe in God.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do. So do you, Storm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. after a fashion .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. yes, I do.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Well, anyway,
now I know what to tell Ross.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He called the captain and issued instructions. The <span class='it'>Vortex
Blaster II</span> darted away at full touring blast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now what?” Cloud asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We practise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Practise what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How should I know? Everything, I guess. Oh, no, the
Fives emphasized ‘scope,’ whatever that means. ‘Scope in
heights and depths.’ Does that ring any bells?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not loud ones, if any. All it suggests to me is spectra
of some kind or other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It could, at that.” Joan caught her lower lip between
her teeth. “But before we start playing scales, let’s see if
we can deduce anything helpful—examine our points of
contact and so on. What have we got to go on?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have one significant point in space. That’s all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh no, it isn’t. You’re forgetting one other highly
significant fact. The data fitted the growth-of-population
curve <span class='it'>exactly</span>, remember.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean to say you <span class='it'>still</span> think the things <span class='it'>breed</span>?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t get away from it, and it isn’t because I’m a
woman and obsessed with offspring, either. How else <span class='it'>could</span>
your data fit that curve, and what else fits it so exactly?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cloud frowned in concentration, but made no reply.
Joan went on: “Assume, as a working hypothesis, that the
vortices are concerned, in that exact relationship, with the
increase in some kind of life. Since the fewer assumptions
we make, the better, we don’t care at the moment what
kind of life it is or whether it’s intelligent or not. To fit the
curve, just what would the vortices have to be? Not
houses, certainly .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. nor bedrooms .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. nor eggs, since
they don’t hatch and the very oldest ones are still there, or
would have been, except for you.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I’m about out of
ideas. How about you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe. My best guess would be incubators .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and
one-shot incubators at that. But with this new angle of
approach I’ve got to re-evaluate the data and see what it
means now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went over to the work-table, studied charts and
diagrams briefly, then thumbed rapidly through a book of
tables. He whistled raucously through his teeth. “This gets
screwier by the minute, but it still checks. Every vortex
represents <span class='it'>twins</span>. Never singles or triplets, <span class='it'>always</span> twins.
And the cycle is so long that the full span of our data isn’t
enough to even validate a wild guess at it. Now, Joan, you
baby expert, just what kind of an infant would be just
comfortably warm and cosy in the middle of a loose
atomic vortex? Feed <span class='it'>that</span> one to Margie, chum, and let’s
see what she does with it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t have to; I can work it in my own little head.
An exceedingly complex, exceedingly long-lived, exceedingly
slow-growing baby of pure force. What else?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ugh! And Ugh! again. That’s twice you’ve slugged me
right in the solar plexus.” Cloud began again to pace the
floor. “Up to now, I was just having fun.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I’m mighty
glad we don’t have to let anybody else in on this, the psychs
would be on our tails in nothing flat .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and the conclusion
would be completely justifiable and we’ve both blown
our stacks.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I’ve been trying to find holes in your theory
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. still am .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but I can’t even <span class='it'>kick</span> a hole in it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When one theory, and only one, fits much observational
data and does not conflict with any, nor with any
known or proven law or fact,” he said finally, aloud, “that
theory, however bizarre, <span class='it'>must</span> be explored. The only thing
is, just how are we going to explore it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what we have to work out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just like that, eh? But before we start, tell me the rest
of it—that stuff you’ve been keeping behind a solid block
down there in the south-east corner of your mind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“QX. I was afraid to, before, but now that you’re
getting sold on the basic idea, I’ll tell all. First, the planet.
There are two possibilities about that. It could have been
cold a long time ago and this race of—of beings, entities,
call them whatever you please—with their peculiar processes
of metabolism, or habits of life, or something, could
have liquefied it and then volatilized it. Or perhaps it
started out hot and the activities of this postulated race
have kept it from cooling; perhaps made it get hotter and
hotter. Either hypothesis is sufficient.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Second, the Patrol couldn’t find anything because it
wasn’t looking for the right category of objects; and
besides, it didn’t have the right equipment to find these
particular objects even if it had known what to look for.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Third, assuming that these beings once lived on that
planet, or on or in its sun, perhaps, they simply <span class='it'>must</span> live
there yet. Creatures of that type, with such a tremendously
long life-span as you have just deduced and as methodical
in thought as they must be, would not move away
except for some very solid reason, and nothing in our data
indicates any significant change in status. Tracking me so
far?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On track to a micro, every millimeter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you don’t think I’ve got rooms for rent upstairs?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you have, I have too. Now that I’m in, I’m going to
follow this thing to its logical conclusion, wherever that
may be. You’ve buttoned up the vortices themselves very
nicely, but they were never the main point at issue, Joan.
That spherical surface was, and still is. <span class='it'>Why</span> is it? And
why such a terrifically long radius? Those have always
been the stickers and they still are. If your theory can’t
explain them, and it hasn’t, so far, it fails.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think you’re wrong, Storm. I don’t think they’ll turn
out to be important at all. They don’t <span class='it'>conflict</span> with the
theory in any way, you know, and as we get more data
I’m pretty sure everything will fit. It fits too beautifully so
far to fail the last test. Besides.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” her thought died
away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Besides what? Unblock, chum. Give.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think those things fit in, already. You see, entities of
pure energy can’t be expected to think the way we do.
When we meet them—if we can understand them at
all—that surface, radius and all, will undoubtedly prove to
be completely in accord with their mode of thought;
system of logic; their semantics; or whatever they have
along those lines.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Could be.” Cloud’s attitude changed sharply. “You’ve
settled one moot point. They’re intelligent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, yes .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. of course they are! It’s funny I didn’t
think of that myself. And you’re really sold, Storm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I really am. Up to now I’ve just been receptive; but
now I really believe the whole cockeyed theory. I suppose
you’ve figured out an angle of approach?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You flatter me. I’m not that good. But perhaps .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in
a very broad and general way.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Heights and depths,
remember? And superhuman scope therein or thereat? But
<span class='it'>we</span> don’t do it, Storm. <span class='it'>You</span> do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Uh-uh. Nix. You and I are one. Let’s go!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll come along as far as I can, of course, but something
tells me it won’t be very far. Lead on, Six Cloud!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where’ll we start?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now we’re right back where we were before. Do you
still favor spectra? Of vibration, say, for a start?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing else but. So let’s slide ourselves up and down
the frequencies, seeing what we can see, hear, feel, or
sense, and what we can do about ’em.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='183' id='Page_183'></span><h1 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>Chapter 18</span><br/> ▂▂▂▂▂▂<span style='font-size:larger'>CAHUITA</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'>ON THE PLANET CAHUITA, unreckonable years before
this story opens, an entity brooded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This entity, Medury by symbol, was not even vaguely
man-like; in fact, he—the third person singular pronoun,
masculine, is used very loosely indeed; but since it is
somewhat better than either “it” or “she” it will have to
do—was not even vaguely corporeal or substantial.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Man’s earliest ancestor, it is believed, came into being
through the interaction of energy and matter in the waters
of the infant seas of Earth. The first Cahuitans, however,
originated in the unimaginably violent, raw, crude energy-flare
of an atomic explosion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This explosion did not take place on Tellus, nor in any
time known to Tellurian history. The place of occurrence
was a planet in the spiral arm of the galaxy across the
tremendous gulf of empty space which we now call Rift
Two Hundred Forty; the time, as has been said, was in the
unthinkably remote past.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cahuitans are not, strictly speaking, immortal; but as
far as mankind is concerned, and except for exceedingly
peculiar violences, they might as well be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Medury brooded. His problem was old; it had probably
been considered, academically, by every Cahuitan then
alive. But only academically, and no Cahuitan had ever
solved it, for the philosophy of the race had always been
(and still is) the simple one of least action—no Cahuitan
ever did any job until it became necessary; but, conversely,
once any job was done it was done as nearly as possible
for all time to come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Medury was the first Cahuitan to be compelled, by one
of the basic urges of life, to deal with the problem as a
concrete, not an abstract, thing. The problem was, therefore,
his. His alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His world, the only planet of its sun, was old, old. The
last atoms of its fissionables had been fissioned; the last
atoms of its fusibles had been fused; no more fires could
be kindled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Cahuitans in general did not care. For the adolescents,
the time of need for a source of high-level quanta
had not yet come. For those already fulfilled<a href='#af'><sup>A</sup></a> it had
passed. While entirely gaseous, the planet would stay comfortably
warm for a long time. Its energies, with the
outpourings of its parent sun, would feed billions of people
instead of the mere hundreds of thousands comprising its
present population. Jobs<a href='#aj'><sup>A</sup></a>, businesses<a href='#ab'><sup>A</sup></a>, commerce<a href='#ac'><sup>A</sup></a>, and
industry<a href='#ai'><sup>A</sup></a> went on as usual, unaffected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Medury was affected: basically, fundamentally
affected. The time had come when he should progress into
completion, and without a new fire the Change was impossible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a time which to a human race would have been
fantastically long Medury brooded, considering every aspect
of the problem; then stirred himself to action. Converting
a tiny portion of his non-material being into three
filaments of energy, he constructed a working platform by
attaching the ends of these three filaments to the cores of
three widely-separated suns. Thus assured of orientation,
he launched into space a probing needle of pure force; a
needle which, propagated in and through the sub-ether,
covered parsecs of distances in microseconds of time. And
thus for days, years, what might have been centuries and
millennia as we of Tellus know time he searched; and
finally, he found.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pulling in all his extensions, he shot a tight beam to a
fellow-being, Litosa by symbol, and tuned his mind precisely
to hers. (“Hers” being perhaps a trifle better than
either “his” or “its”.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For some little time you too have felt the need of
fulfillment,” he informed his proposed complement in
level, passionless thought. “You and I match well; there
being no duplications, no incompatibles, no antagonistics
in our twelve basics. Our fulfillment, Medosalitury, and
our products, Midora and Letusy, would all three be
super-primes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.” What a freight of rebellion against fate was
carried by that monosyllable! “But why discuss it? Why
reach for the unattainable? From now on we die—we <span class='it'>all</span>
die—unfulfilled and without product. All life in this universe—in
this galaxy, at least—ends with us now here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope not. I think not. There are many solar systems.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To what end?” Litosa broke in, her thought a sneer.
“Can you kindle utterly frigid fuel? Can you work in a
sun’s core? Or can you, perhaps, take a piece of star-core
stuff through empty space to a cold planet and.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” The
thought changed in tone, became what would have been
on Earth a schoolgirl’s squeal of rapture:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You CAN! Or you wouldn’t have brought up such a
harrowing subject. You REALLY CAN!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not that, exactly, but something just as good. I found
sparks and kindling on a cold, solid planet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“NO!” The thought was ecstasy. “You DIDN’T!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did. Whenever you’re ready, we’ll go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been ready for CYCLES!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two beings linked themselves together in some
fashion unknowable to man and shot away through the
airless, heatless void. Heatless, but by no means devoid of
energy; the travelers could draw sustenance enough for
their ordinary needs from the cosmic radiation pervading
all space.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Across Rift Two Hundred Forty they flew and on
through interstellar space. They reached our solar system.
On the third planet, our Earth, they found several atomic
power plants. There were no loose atomic vortices—then.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hold on! Wait!” Litosa exclaimed, and the strangely-linked
pair stopped just short of the glowing bit of warmth—the
ragingly incandescent, furiously radiating reactor
in the heart of one of Earth’s largest generating
stations—which was its goal. “There’s something funny
about this. How could there possibly be even one little
spark like this, to say nothing of so many, on such an
utterly frigid planet, unless some intelligent being started it
and is maintaining it for some purpose? There MUST be
intelligence on this planet and we must be intruding
shamefully. Have you scanned? Scanned. CAREFULLY?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have scanned. Carefully, completely. Not only on this
planet’s surface, but throughout its depths. I have
scanned, area by area and volume by volume, this sun and
its every planet, satellite, and asteroid. There is no intelligence
here. More, there is no sign whatever of any kind of
life, however rudimentary, latent, or nascent. I have been
able to find nothing whatever to modify our conclusion of
long and long ago that we are the only life, intelligent or
otherwise, in existence. Scan for yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Litosa scanned. She scanned the sun, the planets, the
moons and moonlets, the asteroids down to grains of sand
and particles of dust. Still unsatisfied, she scanned all
neighboring solar systems, from Centralia to Salvador.
Then, and only then, did she accept Medury’s almost
unacceptable conclusion that these providential sparks
were in fact accidental and were in fact, by some process
as yet unknown to Cahuitan science, self-balancing and
self-sustaining.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Medury and Litosa, woven into a fantastically intricate
and complex sphere of ultra-microscopic filaments, flashed
into the heart of the reactor, which thereupon went instantaneously
and enthusiastically out of control.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And from the pleasant warmth of the incubator-womb—to
us of Earth the ravening fury of the first loose atomic
vortex—there emerged the fulfillment Medosalitury. This
entity, grave and complete and serene as an adult Cahuitan
should be, wafted itself (there is no question as to
which pronoun is to be used here) sedately back to its
home planet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And in the pleasant warmth of that same incubator-womb
the two products, Midora and Letusy, began
very slowly to gestate.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='pindent'>Joan and Storm, minds in fusion, set out to regions
never before explored by man. Downward first. One cycle
per second. One per minute. One per hour; per day; per
year; per century.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hold everything, Storm! You’re getting out beyond my
depth. Anyway, what <span class='it'>use</span> are they in what we’re after?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“None at all, that I can see; but it’s <span class='it'>new knowledge</span>.
Nobody ever dreamed—correction, please: nobody ever
published—anything about it, or I’d’ve heard of it. Maybe
the Fives know all about it, though; I’ll check with them,
first chance I get. QX, we’ll jump up to the radio band.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There wouldn’t be any radio waves out here, and you
couldn’t understand the language if there were.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you know? We’ll go where there are some and
find out. Maybe we can understand <span class='it'>any</span> kind of language
now—maybe that’s one of the natural abilities of a Type
Three-Six fusion. Who knows?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In an instant they were receiving a short-wave broadcast
at the Heaviside Layer of a distant planet. They could
receive it, could de-louse it, could separate signal from
carrier wave, could read the information; but they could
not understand it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, <span class='it'>that’s</span> a relief,” Joan sighed. “I was getting more
than half afraid that a Type Six mind would be omniscient.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I’m a Six you needn’t worry; there’s altogether too
much to know. Where do you want to go from here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s look at the infra-red and the ultra-violet. I’ve
often wondered what colors they would be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fusion looked, and saw things that made both
participants gasp. That is, they did not really <span class='it'>see</span>, either.
None of the six ordinary senses—of perception, sight,
hearing, taste, smell, or touch—were involved. Or rather,
perhaps, all of them were involved, or merged with or into
some other, brand-new sense possessed only by high-type
minds in full action.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As a semanticist, Joan, can you write a paper on that?
That would make any kind of sense, I mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll say I can’t,” Joan breathed. “<span class='it'>Especially</span> as a semanticist,
I can’t. No words, no symbology, in any language.
But weren’t they <span class='it'>beautiful</span>, Storm? And wonderful, and
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and awful?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All of that. I’d like to write it up, or make a tri-di of it
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or something .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but of course we can’t. What next?
Shall we flirt a bit with the cosmics and ultras, or had we
better jump right into the channels of thought?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thought, by all means; the more practise we get, the
better, and they’d be on a terrifically high band, don’t you
think?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bound to be. The logical conclusion of this whole
fantastically cockeyed set-up is that they’ve simply never
even suspected that we exist; any more than we have that
they do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would the .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the bodies, if I can call them that,
radiate of themselves, or just thoughts?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not of themselves, I don’t think .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. no. An entity of
pure energy would have to be held together by forces of
magnitudes we can’t even guess at; much too intense to
permit bodily radiation. Something like the binding energies
of particles, I imagine; but different and very probably
even more so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fusion leaped then to the bands of thought. It
sought out and seized the thoughts of various of the ship’s
personnel; gripping, molding, working, analyzing. Joan and
Cloud were not reading minds now, at all; they were
studying the fundamental mechanisms of the thoughts
themselves. How they were generated; upon what, if anything,
they were heterodyned; how they were transmitted;
and, above all, exactly how they were received and exactly
how they were converted from pure thought, couched at
least in part in the symbols of language, into usefully
assimilable information.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, such was the power of that fusion, it succeeded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then up and up and up the scale of thought the fused
minds went; seeking, finding, mastering. And up and up
and up, into regions where no thoughts at all were to be
found. And up and up, and up.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop it! Let me go! I’m burning out!” Joan shrieked
aloud. “My God, Storm, is there no limit at all to your
ceiling?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cloud stopped; loosed her mind. “I’m sorry, chick, but I
was just getting nicely organized. We’ve got a long ways
to go yet, I’m afraid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry, too, Storm, sorrier than you’ll ever know,
but I simply can’t take it. Three seconds more of that and
I’d’ve gone stark, raving mad. And when we get to Cahuita
I don’t know what I’ll do. I may blow up completely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may think so, but you won’t. You’re not the type.
And we aren’t going to Cahuita—at least, not in the flesh.
When we hit that band we’ll be there automatically.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not quite automatically, of course, but we’ll be there,
yes. I want to stay with you, more than I ever wanted
anything before in my whole life, and I want to help you
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. couldn’t we loosen the fusion just a little, so that I can
pull away when the going gets too rough for me? Just
enough to keep away from a burnout, but close enough to
see and perhaps to help a little?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know why not .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. sure, like this.” He showed
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again the fusion went up and up and up, and this time
it did not stop at Joan’s ceiling. She pulled away a little,
but not enough so that she could not sense and understand,
in a way, what was going on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cloud, every muscle set and eyes closed tight, sat in a
chair, his hands gripping fiercely its arms. Joan lay face
down upon a davenport, her face buried in a pillow, her
fists tight-clenched.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the linked minds—linked now, not fused—went up
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and up .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and up.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, finally, they reached the band upon which a Cahuitan
fulfillment was thinking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It would probably be too much to say that the fulfillment
was surprised. An adult, fulfilled Cahuitan is so
serene, so sedate, so inherently stable at any possible level
of stress, that it is probably impossible for it to feel any
such sensation or emotion as surprise, even at the instantaneous
unveiling of a whole new universe of thought. It
was, however, in a calm, passionless, and scholarly way,
interested. Not what could be called intensely interested,
perhaps, but really interested, nevertheless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As had been foreseen, the modes of thought of the
Cahuitan and the linked Tellurians were different indeed.
As has been shown, however, there were some points—the
fulfillment could remember the emotions of its component
products, even though it could no longer feel them—upon
which even such divergent minds as those could find
common ground. Also, it must be borne in mind that the
Cahuitan was an able and seasoned thinker, trained for
many millennia in the art, and that Neal Cloud was a Type
Six mind; the only such mind then to be found in all
Civilization. Hence, while it would serve no useful purpose
here to go into detail as to how it was accomplished, a
working understanding was at last attained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cloud came to understand, as well as any being of
material substance ever could, the beings of pure energy.
The Cahuitan learned, and broadcast, that intelligent life
could and did exist in intimate association with ultimately
frigid matter. While the probability was small that there
would ever be any considerable amount of fruitful intercourse
between the two kinds of life, some live-and-let-live
arrangement should be and would be worked out. There
were thousands, yes, millions, of planets absolutely useless
to anybody or anything known to man; planets harboring
no life of any kind. The Patrol would be glad to set up, on
any desired number of these barren planets, as many
atomic power plants as the Cahuitans wanted; with controls
set either to let go in an hour or to maintain stability
for twenty five thousand Galactic Standard years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Cahuitans would immediately extinguish all vortices
not containing products, and would move all living products
to the new planets as soon as the promised incubators
were ready.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Products</span> indeed—they’re <span class='it'>babies</span>!” Joan insisted, when
Cloud stepped the information down to her level. “And
how can they possibly move them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Easily enough,” the fulfillment told Cloud. “Blankets of
force will retain the warmth necessary for such short
trips, provided each new incubator is waiting, warm, and
ready.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see. But there’s one question I want to ask for
myself,” and Cloud went on to explain about the unbelievably
huge sphere that crossed Civilization’s vast expanse of
space. “What’s the <span class='it'>reason</span> for it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To save time and effort. The product Medury devoted
much of both to the evaluation of a sufficiently productive,
esthetically satisfying, and mathematically correct
construction. It would not be logical to waste time and
labor in seeking a variant or an alternate, especially since
Medury’s work showed, almost conclusively, that his was
in fact the most symmetrical construction possible. Now
symmetry, to us, is what you might, perhaps, call a ruling
passion in one of your own races.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Symmetry? The first twelve vortices were symmetrical,
of course, but from there on—nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah—that is due to the differences between our thinkings;
particularly in our mathematical and philosophical
thinkings. The circle, the sphere, the square, the cube—all
such elementary forms—are common to both but the
likenesses are few. The differences are many; so many that
it will require several thousands of your Galactic Standard
years for certain of my fellows and me to tabulate them
and to make whatever may be possible of reconciliation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. thanks. One more question .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. maybe I
shouldn’t ask it, but .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. this that we have laid out is a
wide-reaching and extremely important program. Are you
sure that you are able to speak for all the Cahuitans who
will be affected?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sure. Since we are a logical race we all think
alike—logically. On the other hand, your race does not
seem to me at the moment to be at all a logical one. Can
you speak for it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In this matter I can; and you, in my mind, will know
that I can,” and in this case Cloud could indeed speak for
the Patrol. Philip Strong, after one glance in Cloud’s
mind, would issue the necessary orders himself and would
explain later—to anyone capable of accepting the true
explanation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well. We will destroy the empty incubators at
once, and will go ahead with the rest of the project
whenever you are ready.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Cahuitan broke contact and vanished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the ship, Cloud got up. So did Joan. Without exchanging
a word or a thought they went hungrily into each
other’s arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a time, and still keeping one arm around his
Joan, Cloud reached out and punched a button on his
intercom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Captain Ross?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ross speaking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cloud. Mission accomplished. Return to Tellus, please,
at full touring blast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And “Storm” Cloud, Vortex Blaster, was out of a job.</p>

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
